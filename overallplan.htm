      <p>The project team will begin by setting up communication mechanisms and 
        reporting mechanisms for the project. Wherever possible, these will be 
        web based. Interdependencies will be identified. </p>
      <p align="left">Partners representing the various consumer groups (CNIB,CHS) 
        and partners representing various education providers will gather input 
        from potential users of the project deliverables (in many cases this has 
        already been done in preparation for the project proposal). Collectively 
        the partners will create an overall functional specification as well as 
        functional specifications for each individual work package.</p>
      <p align="left">These functional specifications will then be interpreted 
        into technical specifications. Common open standards, protocols and file 
        formats will be agreed upon. Interdependencies will be identified.</p>
      <p align="left">Partners will collectively agree upon detailed project goals 
        to be measured by the evaluation. Partners responsible for project evaluation 
        will develop evaluation mechanisms for both formative and summative evaluation 
        (<a href="evaluation.htm">see Evaluation section</a>).</p>
      <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>
      <h3><a name="iterative"></a>Iterative Development</h3>
      <p align="left">During the iterative development phase of the project, partners 
        will develop a set of alternative input and display technologies that 
        will be integrated into authoring and viewing tools. The alternative display 
        tools include: a customizable, multimedia, overlay captioning tool (ATRC 
        and Ryerson with input from CHS), a customizable descriptive video tool 
        (ATRC and CNIB), XML Schema or DTD for the access tools, a user preference 
        system, a database for indexing the learning objects, viewer/browser customizations 
        and a haptic display tool (Immersion). These will be integrated into a 
        multimedia authoring tool (Expresto) and a captioning tool (VoiceWriter). 
        A media player will be adapted to allow viewing of the alternative display 
        objects produced. </p>
      <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>
      <h3><a name="implement"></a>Implementation</h3>
      <p align="left">From 4 to 6 courseware modules will be chosen that contain 
        content that was previously inaccessible and content requiring broadband 
        networks. These may include both courseware products that have been developed 
        and courseware products presently under development. The courseware products 
        will be enhanced using the tools developed through the project. For example 
        captioning, ASL/LSQ translation, descriptive video, self voicing and haptic 
        demonstrations will be added to a basic physics course. The learner interface 
        will be modified to allow alternative inputs.</p>
      <p align="left">These courseware modules will be launched both in a targeted 
        fashion and to a general audience. Where interactive broadband networks 
        are not available, they will be simulated.</p>
      <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>
      <h3><a name="eval"></a>Evaluation</h3>
      <p align="left">Summative evaluations of the courseware products, the alternative 
        display and control techniques, the learner interactive interface, the 
        media player and the authoring tools will be conducted. Tools and courseware 
        will be modified in response to the evaluation.</p>
      <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>
      <h3><a name="prepare"></a>Prepare for Commercialization and Dissemination</h3>
      <p align="left">Collectively the partners will identify intellectual property 
        that should be commercialized. The original general IP agreement will 
        be enhanced and where appropriate licensing agreements will be created. 
        A detailed strategic commercialization plan will be developed with the 
        assistance of technology transfer departments at both universities and 
        the sales and marketing resources of the industrial partners. </p>
      <p align="left">Formative and summative results will be distributed through 
        the large array of communication channels available to the partners (see 
        Dissemination section of report). A final report will be created (if possible 
        as multimedia courseware) and distributed at conferences, over learning 
        networks and on the more than 15 web sites maintained by the partners. 
        Through partnerships with the National Centre for Accessible Media at 
        WGBH, the report will also be distributed through the US Public Broadcast 
        network.</p>
