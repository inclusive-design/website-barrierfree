This         Java applications allows educators and content developers to combine individual         learning objects into a multi-layer, interactive presentation. The Authoring         Tool can be used to:</p>      <ul>        <li>supplement a video presentation with alternative modalities, including           <ul>            <li>multiple text caption tracks (e.g. different languages, different               reading levels)</li>            <li>multiple audio descriptions (e.g. different languages, etc.)</li>            <li>alternate videos (e.g. ASL translation)</li>          </ul>        </li>        <li> add instructor annotations</li>        <li>add hyperlinks to supplementary information, such as definitions and           web-based material</li>        <li>add graphic overlays, such as diagrams, or highlight indicators</li>      </ul>      <p>The Authoring Tool will be integrated with the Repository, allowing the         user to search the Repository for learning objects which could be added         to the presentation. The Authoring Tool also creates metadata for the         presentation, allowing it to be uploaded to the Repository for other to         use and customize.</p>      <h3><a name="player"></a>Player</h3>      <p> An early version of the Player is currently being tested. This Java         application allows learners to access education material authored using         the Authoring Tool, and configure it according to their own learning style,         as specified in the Learner Preferences.</p>      <p> The Player will load the learner's selected content from the Repository         and configure it according the the learner's presentation preferences.         The Player also provides the learner with access to the navigational structure         of the presentation, allowing the learner to review the material in a         non-linear fashion by navigating directly to any section of the presentation.</p>      <p> The Player allows the learner to modify their content and presentation         preferences while reviewing the presentation, so that for example, the         learner may decide to turn the instructor annotations on or off while         viewing.</p>      <p> The Player presents the hyperlinks in the presentation to the learner,         allowing them to follow the links to view the supplementary information         as they desire.</p>      <h3><a name="user"></a>Learner Preferences</h3>      <p> The learner's personal preferences, stored using XML and CSS, are used         to allow the learner to specify their own choices for selection and presentation         of the material in the educational presentation.</p>      <p> The learner can specify whether or not they wish to view a text caption,         or hear an audio description, and express their preference for which version         of the supplementary material they prefer, based on language preferences,         and other factors such as reading level. They can indicate whether or         not they wish to view any instructor annotation, or supplementary images.</p>      <p> In addition to specifying preferences for selection of content, the         learner can specify how they wish to have that content presented to them.         For example, the appearance of text content can be customized, given different         colour schemes, font sizes, and placement on-screen.</p>      <h3><a name="data"></a>Learning Object Repository</h3>      <p>The Learning Object Repository is designed to provide services to three         classes of user:</p>      <ol>        <li>End users accessing the repository from a web-based search page with           an "off-the-shelf" browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape.</li>        <li>Authors of the complex learning objects who will be using the Authoring           Tool.</li>        <li> End users who access the repository via Player.</li>      </ol>      <p>The repository is organized around a three tier architecture.</p>      <p> The first tier is the database itself. The current implementation uses         Oracle 8i, although the three-tier architecture will make it possible         to replace the present database component with an object-oriented database         or some of the XML databases currently being developed. </p>      <p>The database supports</p>               <ul>          <li> the storage of XML data in database fields. </li>          <li> the ability to search on textual data in much the same way as users             have become accustomed to when using a web-based search engine.</li>          <li>storing large objects such as video and audio files.</li>          <li>maintaining relationships among database objects.</li>        </ul>            <p> The second tier of the learning repository is a "server". The server         communicates with the database component using JDBC (Java Database Connectivity)         and communicates with other software components (the authoring tool and         the player) via Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). To programmers, the         database appears as an object. The server also manages the communication         with the web-based end users. </p>      <p>The third tier of the repository is the client software which runs on         the computers used by the end users. </p>      <p>The database itself contains two major types of components:</p>      <p> "Primitive" objects with associated metadata. Examples of these primitive         objects are videos, caption tracks, text, audio, and graphics. The metadata         which describes them is represented as IMS compatible XML and includes</p>                        <ul>		  <li>general information such as title, language, description, keywords,         etc.</li>          <li> technical information about the resource such as mime type, operating             system requirements, etc.</li>          <li>educational information such as grade level, interactivity level,             typical learning time, etc.</li>        </ul>      <p> The second of the two major database components is what we call an assembly         object. Assembly objects represent collections of the primitive objects         described above and may include other assembly objects. </p>      <p>Like the primitive objects, assembly objects are described by XML metadata.         This metadata includes</p>      <p>         <ul>                  <li> information about the object as a whole. This information is similar           in form and content to metadata describing the primitive objects.</li>          <li>author preferences.</li>          <li>for each learning object			<ul>				<li>a reference pointer to it.</li>				<li>start time and duration information.</li>				<li>positioning and layering information.</li>			</ul>		</li>        </ul>            <p> Database will build indices on the XML metadata fields and attributes         which will permitting rapid searches by end users on any IMS or CANCORE         metadata field. </p>      <p>Free text indices will also be built on caption track data permitting         more precise searches.</p>      <h3><a name="vid"></a>Accessible and Customizable Educational Videos</h3>      <p>The tool and player developed by this project have an important end goal         in mind- the production of accessible and customizable interactive educational         videos. Teacher/authors can use the authoring tool to create educational         videos customized with content related to their own particular classroom,         and designed to meet their partucular student's learning needs. Students,         as learners, can set their own user preferences and engage in supplementary         materials that assist them in their learning. In order to illustrate the         usefulness of these ideals, the partners involved in this project have         collaborated and developed a sample half-hour video. Episode one of the         Canadian Learning Television series "Physics- A World in Motion" has been         enhanced with caption tracks, audio descriptions and a broad range of         supplementary learning materials, including web-based simulations, diagrams,         tables, charts and haptics exercises. This video represents the power         of being able to transform learning materials to meet the individual needs         of both the instructor and the learners.<br>        <a href="../examples/videos.html">Additional information about the "Physics-         A World in Motion" Video Content</a></p>      <h3><a name="sign"></a>Sign Translation Requirements </h3>      <p>In preparing the evaluation material for American Sign Language (ASL)         translation it was determined by the partners that this deliverable should         be expanded. One of the considerations not included in the original plan         was to determine how Broadband systems can help to overcome some of the         problems of traditional broadcast ASL translation. Because of the ability         to view materials in a non-linear fashion, to display overlay graphics         and to show more than one video window, a number of traditional challenges         to effective ASL translation may be overcome in a broadband environment</p>      <p align="right"><i><br>        This page was last updated February 22, 2002</i></p>      .<!-- #EndEditable --><br clear="all">      <div align="center"><img src="../img/footer-line.gif" width="400" height="4">         <p><a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc" class="bttm">Web site hosted           by the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre <img src="../img/final_atrc_logo.gif" width="84" height="59" align="middle" alt="Adaptive Technology Resource Centre Logo" border="0"></a><br>        </p>      </div>    </td>  </tr></table><span class="bttm"></span></body><!-- #EndTemplate --></html>
