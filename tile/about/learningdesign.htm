      <h2>Learning 
        Design</h2>
      <p>Donald Norman 
        has highlighted the risk inherent in using modular, re-usable learning 
        objects: by excessive granularity and modularity we threaten the coherency 
        of the learning experience. Phase 1 of the <a href="http://barrierfree.ca" class="inline">Barrierfree 
        project</a> demonstrated that coherency can be maintained even when personalizing 
        and re-purposing learning objects. This is achieved by providing a coherent 
        story line or learning structure. Through TILE we extend this transformability 
        to media types other than video. A more generic but equivalent learning 
        structure is employed. The backbone of the learning structure is the learning 
        plan, this learning plan can be populated with a number of modular learning 
        objectives, each of which can be populated with any number of content 
        objects. The content objects can include exercises, simulations, publications, 
        self tests, etc. Each content object can be flexible in terms of how it 
        is displayed and how it is controlled. If the content object cannot be 
        transformed directly an equivalent can be available in other modalities. 
        At its simplest, the learning content can be organized in the following 
        hierarchy: <br>
        1) a learning plan assembly object 2) a number of modular learning objective 
        assembly objects, 3) and many associated content objects.</p>
      <p>TILE also 
        addresses the current issues raised at the forefront of Learning Object 
        theory. Leaders in the field have come to realize that instructional design 
        needs to play a larger role in LOR architectures http://wiley.ed.usu.edu/docs/astd.pdf. 
        TILE partners have designed a simple architecture for collaborative and 
        cumulative authoring that is consistent with the latest in learning design 
        theory.</p>
      <p>To understand 
        the functionality developed by TILE, imagine the following example within 
        an adult learning situation:</p>
      <p>&quot;A Week 
        in the Life of a Transformable Learning Object&quot;</p>
      <p>Ryan, a tutor 
        with Frontier College, works with a learner Jim, who would like to learn 
        to use on-line banking, since the trek to the bank is difficult during 
        the winter. Jim needs assistance in learning to use the interface, reading 
        and comprehending the information on the screens, paying the bills that 
        he receives regularly and keeping track of his balances. Ryan uses the 
        on-line learning design structure to specify the overall learning plan 
        and the individual objectives. These he then populates with the actual 
        screens that Jim will encounter at each step, his own clarifications of 
        components of the screen, step by step instructions on how to accomplish 
        each task, ways to recognize and correct errors, and instructions on how 
        to verify that he has been successful. This completed assembly object 
        or lesson is checked into the repository. An accessibility checking tool 
        checks to see that any non-text elements are accessible and guides Ryan 
        in correcting any accessibility errors.</p>
      <p>When Jim 
        views the lesson the service delivers the assembly object according to 
        Jim's previously expressed learner preferences. His preferences specify 
        where, when and how clarifications, instructions, help, and self evaluations 
        will be displayed and how feedback will be given. Because Jim has a learning 
        disability all text will be read to him when he points to it using his 
        head pointer. Because he has difficulty pointing accurately all active 
        areas of the screen such as buttons or input fields will be enlarged.</p>
      <p>Mary is working 
        with a learner, Ferdinand, who uses the same bank but has a different 
        set of bills to pay. She checks out the lesson and replaces the learning 
        content pertaining to the unwanted bills with information about bills 
        relevant to Ferdinand. Because Ferdinand is learning English and is more 
        conversant in Spanish, Mary adds a Spanish translation of the clarifications 
        and instructions, help and feedback. Mary also remembers a very simple 
        to use accessible calculator that she has previously seen in a linked 
        repository. She searches for it and adds a link to it. She then checks 
        this new version of the lesson or assembly object into the repository. 
        When Ferdinand accesses the lesson he reads and listens to both the English 
        and Spanish text.</p>
      <p>Judith is 
        a trainer with the bank referenced in the lesson. She has just created 
        an educational video about on-line banking. She uses the Barrierfree tool 
        to structure the synchronized verbatim captions of the video and then 
        links the indexed segments of the video to the appropriate points in the 
        learning plan. When Jim next views the lesson he can choose to reinforce 
        what he is learning with the instructional video.</p>
      <p>Alfred is 
        a tutor working with a class who need to access the on-line banking service 
        of another bank. He views the lesson and decides that he likes the structure 
        of the learning plan and many of the generic explanations, but he must 
        replace the screen shots and detailed instructions. After doing this he 
        checks the new version of the lesson or assembly object into the repository.</p>
      <p>The repository 
        has a record of each instance of the assembly object as well as the cumulative 
        master assembly object. Thus the next educator/author can view and use 
        resources from any of the derivative assembly objects.</p></td>
