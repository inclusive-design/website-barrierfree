      <h2>Learning 
        Object Repository - LOR</h2>
      <p>Learning 
        Object Repository (LOR) functionality can be divided into three levels. 
        The first level offers sharable learning objects. At this level the LOR 
        has the functionality of a library. The learning objects are retrieved 
        and used as they were checked in by the original author. The structure 
        of the learning object and the LOR architecture do not support their deconstruction 
        and re-purposing other than to accommodate alternative hardware platforms. 
        Most learning object repositories in Canada and elsewhere fit into this 
        category.</p>
      <p>However, 
        most educators would like to customize learning content to their learning 
        context. The second level of functionality provides support for learning 
        object re-purposing. The learning content is sufficiently structured or 
        sufficiently granular to allow educators to swap components to adapt the 
        learning object to a specific curriculum requirement, local context or 
        background knowledge. A number of LORs around the world are just beginning 
        to explore this functionality to positive effect.</p>
      <p>The third 
        level of functionality acknowledges that learners are very diverse. Each 
        learner brings to the learning situation their own unique set of skills, 
        background knowledge, motivations, learning goals, learning approaches, 
        learning pace and accessibility needs. This level of functionality supports 
        the construction of learning content that is independent of presentation 
        and control. It provides enough structure and granularity to allow the 
        reassembly of learning content according to the needs and preferences 
        of the learner. This level of functionality is virtually unexplored.</p>
      <p>The <a href="http://barrierfree.ca" class="inline">Barrierfree 
        project</a> developed this functionality for interactive video objects 
        and their associated media objects. This project furthers this work by 
        expanding the functionality to include the range of media types used in 
        e-learning and by expanding the types of user preferences that can be 
        responded to. This provides a new level of functionality that does not 
        merely provide equivalents to existing learning paradigms and tools but 
        introduces innovative approaches to learning that are only made possible 
        through broadband network delivered education. Presently no learning object 
        repository is compliant with even basic accessibility guidelines with 
        the exception of the <a href="http://barrierfree.ca" class="inline">Barrierfree Repository</a>. 
        TILE works with other Canadian LOR initiatives to insure that accessibility 
        guidelines are followed.</p></td>
