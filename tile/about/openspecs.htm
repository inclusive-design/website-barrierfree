        Specifications and Standards - National and International Interoperability</h2>
      <p> Several 
        standards bodies look to the project partners to propose specifications 
        for accessible e-learning. Jutta Treviranus was the Chair of the IMS Global 
        Learning Consortium Accessibility for Learner Information Package (ACCLIP) 
        Working Group, and is currently Co-Chair of the Accessibility Profile 
        Working Group. She has undertaken the task of drafting extensions to the 
        Learner Information Package Specification and the MetaData Specification 
        to accommodate accessible e-learning. As a result, the extension to the 
        IMS Learner Information Package called the AccessForAll element (aka ACCLIP) 
        has been adopted as an IMS recommendation. It was the first IMS specification 
        to be adopted without negative votes or requests for revisions. At the 
        same time, it became clear that the IMS Learning Design specification 
        does not enable markup of the kind required by TILE despite the fact that 
        it is a stated goal of the LD working group and specification. Members 
        of the LD working group and TILE continue to work together to address 
        this. Work on extensions to the IMS Metadata specifications to accommodate 
        accessibility requirements are productive and ongoing.</p>
      <p>To insure 
        that this work is reflected in other internationally adopted specifications 
        Jutta is also a member of the Dublin Core Accessibility Working Group 
        and the Chair of the W3C Authoring Tool Working Group. Discussions are 
        underway with the developers of CanCore to either inherit or proactively 
        adopt the accessibility extensions to IMS Metadata specifications. The 
        ATRC is consulting to implementers of SCORM regarding the SCORM API and 
        accessibility. Discussions are also underway with the developers of EML 
        regarding accessibility and EML. The proposed project will not only adhere 
        to appropriate international standards and interoperability specifications 
        such as IMS, IEEE LOM, Dublin Core, and CanCore, it will serve to guide 
        the extensions of these standards.</p>
      <p>CANARIE played 
        a critical role in the development of the World Wide Web Consortium, Web 
        Accessibility Standards. The impetus to create an accessibility initiative 
        within the W3C was driven by a project led by SoftQuad in partnership 
        with the ATRC and funded by CANARIE. The W3C Web Accessibility guidelines 
        now form the basis for legislation and regulations in at least 3 continents, 
        including the US Rehab 508, Australian Human Rights legislation, the Barrierfree 
        Europe initiative and Canada's Common Look and Feel. Continued support 
        of a similar initiative in e-learning will have far reaching effects. 
        Key international specification and standards bodies are receptive and 
        expectant of direction from the project partners regarding accessible 
        e-learning.</p></td>
