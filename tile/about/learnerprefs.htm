        Preferences </h2>
      <p>One of the 
        opportunities afforded by broadband networks is a highly responsive dynamic 
        web interface. Broadband networks open the communication channel in both 
        directions, enabling educational servers that can respond to each individual 
        learner and learning context in a timely manner. With the right tools 
        this provides the opportunity to introduce a new level of learner-centric 
        education that is inclusive of all learners.</p>
      <p>Most learners 
        and educators would agree that the ideal educational environment has at 
        its core one-on-one teaching that is closely customized to the needs of 
        the individual learner. In all current educational sectors, one-on-one 
        teaching is very rare. Learners must make-do with instruction geared toward 
        the average student or the perceived norm. This leads to a large segment 
        of marginalized students who do not fit the norm. They may differ in their 
        background knowledge, level of understanding of the topic, learning outcome 
        goals, learning style, learning skills and accessibility needs. With dynamic 
        web technologies and broadband we have the opportunity to deliver the 
        approximation of one-on-one teaching. The on-line educational environment 
        could be responsive to a number of learner needs and preferences. These 
        preferences could be general learning preferences or preferences related 
        to a particular learning session.</p>
      <p>The project 
        demonstrates the potential benefits of personalized courseware for the 
        learner and the impact this will have on the educator or content producer. 
        A core assumption of learner-centric courseware delivery, whether it is 
        simply providing device independent information or full learning-style 
        accommodation, is that the content delivery medium can be independent 
        of the content while still achieving a consistent learning outcome. This 
        requires a dramatic shift in instructional design that most educators 
        are not cognizant of when designing learning material for the web. It 
        requires a deconstruction of teaching and a new set of authoring tools 
        and supports. Most web-authoring tool features concentrate on the specific 
        visual presentation of the material. They do not assist the author in 
        extracting the content and structure and determining whether it transforms 
        gracefully while still retaining the intended learning message. Most educators 
        devote a great deal of attention to designing the presentation of the 
        learning content at the expense of refining the content and its structure. 
        Through this project we demonstrate the practical boundaries of transformable 
        content and the tools needed to support the mastery of learner customizable 
        teaching.</p>
      <p>From a list 
        of candidate preferences, we selected a refined list to be exposed in 
        the TILE Preference Wizard. The remaining preferences are implicitly addressed.</p>
      <h2>The 
        general preferences exposed in the Preference Wizard include:</h2>
      <ul class="bullet" >
        <li>Styling 
          preferences: This includes the information layout, the font size, and 
          the colours used on the page. For someone with low vision this may make 
          the difference between illegible and legible content.</li>
        <li>Depth 
          of Navigation Tree: Some learners prefer to have all possible links 
          shown on one page while others prefer to have top level links with lower 
          level links appearing on subsequent linked-to pages.</li>
        <li>Equivalent 
          Content Requirements: Learners with sensory impairments require streaming 
          auditory or visual information to be provided in another modality but 
          synchronized to the primary content. The system can provide the requested 
          type of equivalent content (captioning, ASL, video description) delivered 
          according to the user's preference (styling, layout, reading level, 
          etc.)</li>
        <li>Language: 
          The learner may have an alternative language requirement, or may wish 
          the content to be displayed in two languages to support better comprehension. 
          </li>
        <li>Content 
          Density: Some learners prefer to master an overview of the content and 
          then learn the specifics of each subtopic, while others prefer to move 
          sequentially through all the details of the topic.</li>
        <li>Learner 
          Scaffolding types: Learners require individualized learner supports. 
          Some learners benefit from readily available definitions of terms, others 
          benefit from exercises or illustrations of concepts, while still others 
          require peer interaction to fully integrate a concept.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Preferences 
        that relate to a specific learning session exposed in the Preference Wizard 
        include:</h2>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li> Learner 
          Outcome Goals: Learners approach learning content with different outcome 
          goals. A system that organizes content in support of the outcome goal 
          and assists the user in tracking their progression toward the goal may 
          assist in achieving the learning outcome.</li>
        <li>Topic 
          Exclusions: In some instances, less is more. A filter to exclude content 
          that is not of interest or is already learned may help the learner to 
          focus on the target content.</font></li>
        <li>Placeholders, 
          Annotation and Knowledge Review: Progression through specific learning 
          content would be supported by allowing the learner to create placeholders, 
          personal annotations and by creating a synopsis or review of the previous 
          session.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Candidate 
        general preferences that are implicitly addressed include:</h2>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li> Classification 
          or Sorting Preferences: Mail archives frequently offer the choice of 
          sorting by sender, date, subject, priority level among others. Other 
          sorting criteria could include level of difficulty, match with expressed 
          learning outcome goals and teaching style.</li>
        <li>Access 
          Requirements: Learners with disabilities frequently require alternative 
          access strategies such as screen reading for people who blind, or on-screen 
          keyboards for people who cannot use a mouse or keyboard. The preferences 
          can address both the type of alternative access technology and the preference 
          settings for the access technology. (e.g., voice rate and pitch, key 
          size and spacing)</font></li>
        <li>Testing 
          Equivalents: Learners with disabilities or language constraints are 
          unable to answer certain kinds of test questions. These individuals 
          require test questions in an accessible modality that are equivalent 
          in the skills or knowledge being tested.</font></li>
        <li>Content 
          Views (Image intensive, text intensive): Some learners are best supported 
          through visual illustrations of the content, while graphics and images 
          may be distracting or inaccessible to other learners.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>One 
        candidate preference that relates to a specific learning session is implicitly 
        addressed:</h2>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li> Facilitation 
          of Communities of Interest. Learners vary regarding their preference 
          for the frequency and timing of peer interaction in support of learning. 
          Methods of facilitating group interaction while respecting personal 
          preferences will be investigate.</li>
