      <p>Repository Design 
        and Architecture, Repository Service Web Interface (RSWI) and Authoring 
        Tool Design and Development<br>
        Note: While originally separated into distinct tasks these tasks are being 
        described together because the development of the tools and technologies 
        are highly interdependent. The TILE services are evolving into a single 
        integrated system, and work on all &#8216;parts&#8217; is progressing 
        in parallel.</p>
      <p>The focus in the past 
        quarter has been on refinement of the integration of the various transformations 
        and services into a whole, and on the interaction between the Web Interface 
        and the Repository. This work is being done in conjunction with the work 
        on the Authoring Tool interaction with the Repository, and is shaping 
        the Repository API. Finalization of the API is dependent on a more stable 
        IMS Metadata extension draft (see Develop IMS Accessibility Specifications 
        below).</p>
      <p>Work proceeds on the Alternate Content selection algorithm that is based 
        on our extensions to the metadata specification, and on the implementation 
        of the other transformations. The RSWI now implements annotation, topic 
        exclusion, learner goals, as well as a classroom paradigm for course &#8216;enrollment.&#8217;</p>
      <p>An additional focus 
        has been on communication between the Authoring Tool and the Repository. 
        An Authoring Tool / Repository Interaction Specification has been written 
        and partially implemented awaiting the Metadata extension draft.</p>
      <h2>Develop IMS Accessibility Specifications</h2>
      <p> As previously reported TILE activities are dependent on the finalization 
        or extensions of several IMS specifications. By embedding the TILE innovations 
        into these international standards the impact of TILE will be much more 
        far reaching, ensuring that all IMS compliant technologies worldwide will 
        be more accessible. </p>
      <p>During this quarter 
        the extension to the IMS Learner Information Package called the AccessForAll 
        element (aka ACCLIP) has been adopted as an IMS recommendation. It was 
        the first IMS specification to be adopted without negative votes or requests 
        for revisions. During the previous quarter it became clear that the Learning 
        Design specification does not enable markup of the kind required by TILE 
        despite the fact that it is a stated goal of the LD working group and 
        specification. Members of the LD working group and TILE continue to work 
        together to address this. The Content Packaging specification does not 
        accommodate alternative or augmentative content. A proposal was put forth 
        to include this in the last maintenance release but it was felt by the 
        Technical Board that this was more than a maintenance revision. A group 
        will be chartered in the beginning of 2004 to address this. QTI will inherit 
        changes to the Content Packaging specification once they are finalized.</p>
      <p>Extensions are required to Metadata specifications to accommodate accessibility 
        requirements. During this quarter an IMS charter was drafted (by TILE 
        members) and passed by the IMS Technical Board. The charter is far broader 
        than traditional IMS charters. The group proposes to bring together the 
        major groups working on Metadata standards to collectively arrive at a 
        common set of accessibility Metadata extensions. These extensions would 
        include Metadata regarding accessibility specification compliance (e.g., 
        W3C WCAG compliance) and Metadata elements that correspond to AccessForAll. 
        To date the group has been successful in recruiting participation from 
        Dublin Core, IEEE, CEN-ISSS, Incite V2, CanCore, SCORM, W3C CC/PP, WCAG 
        and Semantic Web. This group is chaired by Jutta Treviranus and Toni Roberts.</p>
      <p>Within the constraints 
        imposed by the progress toward the necessary specification extensions 
        within IMS, progress toward deliverable completion is on schedule. Finalization 
        of the authoring tool and repository is dependent on a fairly stable Metadata 
        extension. Extensive work to finalize these tools and environments was 
        halted until the draft extension was reviewed by the new IMS working group. 
        </p>
      <h2>Content Creation and Conversion</h2>
      <p> The following is a synopsis of the progress made by various partners 
        during Q3 2003 with respect to the provision of content for the TILE project:</p>
      <p>Transitional Year 
        Program (TYP) Content<br>
        Learning Skills Series<br>
        A complete module on Reading and Note taking has been finalized. Additional 
        content modules on various aspects of the TYP learning Skills Series have 
        been marked up according to W3C WAI guidelines and readied for online 
        delivery.</p>
      <p>Cancore Metadata has 
        been constructed/assembled for this content.</p>
      <p>Reasoning In The Sciences<br>
        Initial course material, including outline and objectives, has been assembled. 
        A detailed syllabus has been prepared for online delivery. Instructional 
        design work has been initiated in order to ascertain the most effective 
        manner in which to deliver and repurpose content. A detailed series of 
        course objectives has been assembled that will be used to construct learning 
        pathways with the online tool, once it is ready for full production use.</p>
      <p>Cancore Metadata templates 
        have been constructed for this content.</p>
      <p>Quantitative Reasoning</p>
      <p> A course outline for this course has been constructed based on initial 
        instructional design meetings held with the course instructor. Resources 
        have been assembled, and a detailed list of these is being prepared for 
        online delivery. These resources will be used in conjunction with course 
        material to create an online learning environment that will be linked 
        to aspects of the Learning Skills Series modules. </p>
      <p>Cancore Metadata templates 
        have been constructed for this content.</p>
      <p>National Adult Literacy 
        Database (NALD)<br>
        NALD content has been preselected based on its potential for reuse within 
        the TILE system. This content, as well as the NALD database in general, 
        is in the final stages of being checked for W3C WAI guideline compliance. 
        New content on Technology and Literacy has been made available, and instructional 
        design to incorporate this material is underway.</p>
      <p>Cancore Metadata templates 
        have been constructed for this content, and some Metadata has been assembled.</p>
      <p>Centre of Excellence for Research on Immigration and Settlement (CERIS)</p>
      <p> An extensive audit on one of the CERIS courses has been conducted, resulting 
        in a complex overview of the course content and structure (total size: 
        3.32GB). Design decisions have been taken to select the content that will 
        be marked up with Cancore metadata, and a template for this has been constructed.</p>
      <p>Frontier College<br>
        A tutor&#8217;s guide booklet has been digitized (scanned and OCR) and 
        broken up into 40+ individual pages for simplicity of navigation. </p>
      <p>Ryerson<br>
        Accessibility<br>
        Work has continued on preparation of content from Joe Clark&#8217;s recently 
        published book on Accessibility. Cancore metatdata has been created based 
        on the template the ATRC has provided. <br>
        Negotiations are underway with Alias for ten, one-minute training videos 
        with open captions.</p>
      <p>Community Access and Technology<br>
        Content has been prepared for the thirteen-week course on Community Access 
        and Technology, including sections covering people profiles (movers and 
        shakers), adaptive device overview, links to other content/external repositories 
        and other resources. Cancore metatdata is being prepared based on the 
        template the ATRC has provided. Structuring of the content for Learning 
        Design and Content Packaging is also underway.</p>
      <p>SNOW<br>
        Authoring of content is complete for an additional SNOW workshop module 
        on the topic of the accessibility of courseware packages currently available 
        on the market. Testing is occurring regarding Content Packaging interoperability 
        between the current SNOW courseware tool, ATutor, and the TILE repository.</p>
      <p>Canadian Learning Television (CLT)<br>
        The current focus of work with CLT is resolution of intellectual property 
        and copyright issues related to use of their educational content. ATRC 
        staff are currently working in consultation with this partner to drafting 
        an IP policy regarding CLT content. </p>
      <p>Digital Frog International 
        (DFI)<br>
        During this quarter DFI released a science matrix beta for user testing. 
        This is currently available online at http://www.sciencematrix.com/ </p>
      <h2>Barrierfree Implementation in the ABEL Project</h2>
      <p>While awaiting tentative approval of the Metadata proposal the technical 
        team was engaged in an additional task. As discussed with CANARIE, the 
        Barrierfree Tools and environment is being deployed within the ABEL project. 
        This required a number of revisions to accommodate the specific IP and 
        permission concerns of ABEL. </p>
      <p>During the third quarter, 
        the Barrier-Free tools (the Barrier-Free Editor and Player, and Repository 
        technology) have been revised and improved for use in the ABEL project. 
        This work has included the following:</p>
      <p>The user interface 
        has been altered to improve usability within the ABEL environment, based 
        on user feedback and testing.</p>
      <p>Support for an external 
        streaming media server has been added to the repository software.</p>
      <p>A tutorial demonstrating 
        how to use the Barrier-Free Editor is complete, and will be made available 
        to the ABEL teachers along with the software.</p>
      <p>The tools have been 
        ported to and tested on Mac OS 9, Mac OS X and Windows.</p>
      <p> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>July 1, 2003</p>
      <p>Repository Services 
        Web Interface<br>
        The Repository Services Web Interface (RSWI) will be the front end of 
        the TILE services. It will provide learners and educators with access 
        to the repository content, customized to their own learning and access 
        preferences.</p>
      <p>The underlying core 
        architecture of the system has been implemented. The Preferences Wizard, 
        which will assist learners in recording their preferences for use by the 
        system, is also complete. The user interface (a consistent look &amp; 
        feel) for the wizard, and for the TILE web services in general, is being 
        refined through iterative user testing.</p>
      <p>Work is underway on 
        the various technologies needed to transform content according to learner 
        preferences. Our original list of eleven candidate transformations has 
        been reduced, through partner feedback, to a shortlist of nine transformations. 
        Of these nine, three are complete, and we are working on the technologies 
        necessary to carry out the others.</p>
      <p>Authoring Tool<br>
        The TILE Authoring Tool will assist educators in creating learning content 
        that is easily transformed according to learner preferences. The Authoring 
        Tool is evolving to be an integral part of the RSWI, sharing much of the 
        underlying technology, and development is proceeding in concert with the 
        RSWI work.</p>
      <p>Authoring Tool Support 
        for Accessibility.<br>
        We have begun working on integrating the A-Prompt evaluation engine into 
        the TILE Authoring Tool development. This technology help to ensure that 
        content being submitted to the repository follows recommended web accessibility 
        guidelines.</p>
      <p>IMS Deliverables<br>
        The IMS ACCLIP (Accessibility for the Learner Information Package) specification 
        is now publicly available on the IMS website (http://imsglobal.org/accessibility/). 
        A working group has been formed to update the IMS Metadata specification 
        to ensure that resources described by IMS Metada can be transformed according 
        to the preferences encapsulated in the ACCLIP. We are active participants 
        in this working group. </p>
      <p>Content Development<br>
        Partners continue to prepare content for the repository, including material 
        on the following topics:</p>
      <p>Reading and Note Taking 
        <br>
        Adult Literacy <br>
        Web Accessibility <br>
        Community Access and Technology <br>
        New Developments in Accessible Curriculum <br>
        Video-based Science Curriculum <br>
        Photosynthesis and Biology <br>
        Currently the content is being prepared for web delivery, including metatagging 
        according to CanCore specificiations.</p>
      <p> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>April 1, 2003</p>
      <p>IMS Deliverables<br>
        The projected technical deliverables were based on the assumption that 
        the IMS Learning Design specification could be used as the basis for the 
        Core Architecture Design that would be shared by the tools associated 
        with the project. Over the last two quarters the technical team has attempted 
        to apply the IMS LD XML binding to the functionality required in TILE 
        without success. Meetings have been held with members of the IMS LD working 
        group and the EML group (upon which LD is based). While the group all 
        are of the opinion that the LD specification should do what TILE requires, 
        that what we require was an explicit objective of the LD specification, 
        they also understand that it presently does not accomplish what we need. 
        The IMS working group have recommended that TILE propose an extension 
        to LD. Thus rather than applying an existing schema, the TILE project 
        must create an extension to the IMS LD schema. The project partners have 
        considered adjusting the functional specifications to fit the capabilities 
        of the Learning Design specifications but it was felt that this would 
        compromise the primary objective of TILE and make it harder for educators 
        to create transformable learning content. For these reasons an additional 
        task and deliverable has been added to the project. The impact of this 
        to the e-learning field worldwide is potentially fairly significant. What 
        TILE requires is a departure from the perspective of the lesson or course 
        as a sequential series of events. TILE takes the perspective that there 
        is an intended learning outcome, objective or &#8220;competency criterion&#8221; 
        and several alternative activities that a learner can engage in to achieve 
        the intended learning objective. This learning object structure lends 
        itself well to cumulative or collaborative authoring. Educator/authors 
        can contribute alternative learning activities that support a particular 
        learning objective.</p>
      <p>While the Learning 
        Design specification cannot be used as expected, the IMS ACCLIP specification 
        has reached the Public Draft stage and is sufficiently stable to apply 
        to the preference tools. Given that the Barrierfree and TILE staff led 
        the ACCLIP activity, the specification encompasses all of the requirements 
        of TILE regarding learner preferences.</p>
      <p>During several forums 
        with content partners and educators it was stressed that more research 
        was required into scaffolds and supports for educators or authors of learning 
        content. To this end several research activities have been shifted to 
        concentrate on the needs of the educator when using a LOR to support inclusive 
        teaching rather than to learning outcomes given specific transformation 
        alternatives. The point was also made that learning outcome findings for 
        the identified group could not be easily applied generally. Given the 
        approach taken in this project, learning outcome gains made by a very 
        small number of learners would justify inclusion of a particular transformation.</p>
      <p>Given the shortcomings 
        of the IMS LD specification, finalization of the core architecture has 
        been further delayed. All technologies not dependent on Learning Design 
        have progressed on schedule. All other deliverables and tasks not dependent 
        on this specification have been completed as projected. Several tasks 
        not scheduled for this quarter have been moved forward to ensure project 
        completion on time.</p>
      <p>Repository design 
        and architecture<br>
        Functional specifications for the repository design and core architecture 
        are complete.<br>
        Technical specifications are complete with the exception of the components 
        dependent on the LD specification extension.</p>
      <p>Repository Service 
        Web Interface<br>
        The functional specification is complete and undergoing partner review. 
        The technical specifications and Core architecture design are complete 
        with the exception of the components dependent on the LD specification 
        extension. </p>
      <p>Communication between 
        preference system and Web Interface<br>
        Development is complete with the exception of the components dependent 
        on the LD specification extension.</p>
      <p>Authoring Tool<br>
        The functional specification is complete and undergoing partner review.<br>
        The technical specifications and Core architecture are complete with the 
        exception of the components dependent on the LD specification extension.</p>
      <p>Authoring Tool Support 
        for Accessibility<br>
        We have been working with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 
        working group to ensure that any new requirements being incorporated into 
        the latest version will be reflected in the Authoring Tool accessibility 
        checking. This work includes a specifications document that maps the original 
        WCAG guidelines to the proposed new guidelines, and changes to our software 
        to accommodate changes in the guidelines.</p>
      <p>Draft common query 
        protocol<br>
        This deliverable is dependent on collaboration with the Edusource project. 
        Discussions have begun. The TILE project has drafted an API as has the 
        Edusource project. </p>
      <p>Community Kitchen 
        Event<br>
        On February 28, 2003, participants gathered at the University of Toronto 
        for the first TILE Community Potluck event, coordinated by the ATRC. Representatives 
        from across Canada participated. The theme of this first community potluck 
        was &quot;Shaping Content&quot; with participants in attendance taking 
        part in a learning exercise aimed at introducing those present to the 
        idea of shaping content using learning objects. The TILE Community Potluck 
        raised several significant points related to authoring processes that 
        will require further exploration, while simultaneously providing project 
        participants with a first-hand view of the benefits of reusable transformable 
        e-learning content. Canadian Learning Television was on hand filming this 
        TILE community potluck event for use in a television spot about the project 
        to be aired at a later date. Plans are underway for an event to be held 
        in Alberta during the second quarter.</p>
      <p>Learning Object Classifieds<br>
        A learning object classifieds was added to the web site.</p>
      <p>Web Newsletter <br>
        A web newsletter was published and distributed to partners and collaborators 
        and event participants.</p>
      <p>Learning Outcome evaluation 
        reports<br>
        Participant observation protocols were developed for this event to observe 
        and capture data on how content partners would envision reusing learning 
        objects. We gained valuable insight on this process that should enable 
        the programmers to develop tools that support varying users who will use 
        the software for various output requirements.</p>
      <p>Content<br>
        Liaison has continued between the content development team from the ATRC 
        and the community partners. Discussions have focussed on selection of 
        appropriate content for sharing, W3C WAI compliance, and development of 
        learning design (instructional design) scaffolding. </p>
      <p>NALD: Retrieval 
        content has been identified, and preliminary work on learning design markup 
        is in place. The latter will continue based on liaison with CanCore on 
        how to process the DTD. Information on the recommended process for conducting 
        the CanCore markup is being developed and will be forwarded to NALD. <br>
        TYP: A proof of concept example for one TYP &#8220;mini lessons&#8221; 
        has been completed and we are now working on conjoining this with others. 
        Contact with some TYP instructors has proved difficult. Content team liaison 
        is pursuing communication regarding content development and will confirm 
        participation of specific instructors with TYP Director. <br>
        CERIS: We have an abundance of content for CERIS and have established 
        a reusability schema for this content. The content is ready to be processed 
        for markup. Next steps will be establishing and filling any gaps that 
        remain in the overall reusability instructional design. <br>
        CLT has continued to work on identifying suitable content for inclusion 
        in the learning objects repository. The focus has been on science based 
        videos including chemistry, physics and biology. <br>
        Frontier College has supplied several key text based resources for inclusion 
        in the repository including their volunteer training manual and a book 
        outlining specific strategies for working with children and youth requiring 
        literacy support. <br>
        Digital Frog has continued development of their interactive learning object 
        focussed on the process of photosynthesis. This interactive lesson includes 
        graphical images, interactive activities and important science content 
        and all are presented in an accessible format, intended to allow computer 
        mediated use by students of all abilities. <br>
        CDRTI has been working to identify priorities regarding which deaf literacy 
        related learning resources are best suited to conversion to electronic 
        format and inclusion in the learning object repository. <br>
        SNOW team members have identified appropriate content from the IDEA program. 
        The content is ready for markup. Existing workshop content related to 
        adaptive technology has been revised and discussions have taken place 
        with Ryerson partners regarding opportunities for sharing content.</p>
      <p> --------------------------------------------------------------------------------</p>
      <p>January 2003</p>
      <p>Project Reporting 
        and Progress Tracking System<br>
        An on-line time sheet and partner reporting system has been finalized 
        and used in generating this quarterly report. </p>
      <p>IMS Deliverables <br>
        A proposal was submitted to the IMS ACCLIP (Accessibility for the Learner 
        Information Package) working group consisting of a draft schema, an information 
        model, use cases and an object model. These were reviewed at the IMS face 
        to face meetings hosted by ATRC in Toronto in December. The ATRC prepared 
        a set of exemplary models using the proposed schema and XML binding. </p>
      <p>Learning Design Forum 
        <br>
        A learning design forum was held to discuss the learning challenges to 
        be addressed through the TILE project and strategize how mechanisms such 
        as transformations and selective retrieval of learning content can be 
        used to address these challenges. </p>
      <p>Prototypes of candidate 
        preference transformations Illustrative prototypes and mockups of candidate 
        preference transformations were created and presented to the IMS working 
        group and to partner experts. </p>
      <p>Content <br>
        Preparation of the content testbed has been moved forward. Copyright clearance 
        (where applicable), conversion to compliant on-line formats and accessibility 
        repair have begun. </p>
      <p>Core Architecture 
        Design <br>
        The design of the core architecture (which affects all of the technologies 
        to be developed by the project) is nearing completion. The design is dependent 
        on the IMS LIP specification (see above). We expect to begin implementation 
        early in the next quarter. </p>
      <p>Functional Specifications 
        <br>
        Drafts of the Repository Services Web Interface and Preferences Wizard 
        being written, and will be distributed to project partners for review 
        in the first quarter of 2003. </p>
      <p>Authoring Tool Support 
        for Accessibility <br>
        A questionnaire was constructed and distributed to over 100 A-Prompt users 
        worldwide. Results are being used to determine what users require in their 
        reports in a learning object repository context. We have created several 
        mockups of various reports and will be showing them to current A-Prompt 
        users in the next 2 months.<br>
