      <p>Progress 
        Report<br>
        January 1, 2004 </p>
      <h3>IMS Deliverables</h3>
        <p>As previously reported TILE activities are dependent on the finalization 
        or extensions of several IMS specifications. By embedding the TILE innovations 
        into these international standards the impact of TILE will be much more 
        far reaching, ensuring that all IMS compliant technologies worldwide will 
        be more accessible. The TILE authoring tools and repository service is 
        dependent on the proposed Metadata extension.</p>
      <p>The proposed 
        Metadata extension to IEEE LOM and Dublin Core will not be completed within 
        the timeline of the TILE project. As there is no opportunity to extend 
        the project TILE will finalize the tools with the draft extension as proposed 
        to the IMS working group (by the TILE project). As soon as the project 
        received word from CANARIE that there is no opportunity for extension 
        the ATRC began finalizing the tools using the draft extension. </p>
      <h4>Repository Service Web Interface</h4>
      <p> During the 
        last quarter of 2003, the Repository Services Web Interface has neared 
        completion:</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li> the Alternate 
          Content selection algorithm is complete, and is undergoing testing;</li>
        <li> the set 
          of metadata fields that can be searched has been expanded, and searching 
          can be refined by resource type;</li>
        <li> learner 
          sessions can be saved, so that status of progress through a Content 
          Package can be restored on subsequent visits; and</li>
        <li> the user 
          interface has undergone several cycles of iterative evaluation and development.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The RSWI 
        will undergo one final round of evaluation before completion.</p>
      <h4>Authoring Tool</h4>
        <p>The Authoring Tool completion with the draft Metadata specification began 
        in earnest in the end of December following notification by CANARIE. Specifically, 
        we have implemented:</p>
      <ul class="bullet">
        <li> resource 
          uploading;</li>
        <li> definition 
          of learning objectives;</li>
        <li> assignment 
          of resources to objectives;</li>
        <li> specification 
          of alternative resources; and</li>
        <li> collection 
          of metadata (partially complete).</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The user 
        interface for this functionality has been implemented as a form of &#8216;wizard&#8217; 
        that allows the author to progress through these stages in an intuitive 
        manner, as well as being able to return to earlier states to modify or 
        add information. This interface is integrated into the TILE website, and 
        is accessible by logging in as a registered author.</p>
      <h4>Preference Wizard for TILE</h4>
        <p>The Preference Wizard was completed. Iterative testing resulted in rewording 
        and restructuring of default queries. </p>
      <h4>Authoring 
        Tool Support for Accessibility</h4>
        <p>The beta version of the accessibility checker is complete and we will 
        be starting user testing of the software. There are currently 25 accessibility 
        checks that are implemented and we are rapidly adding more. The system 
        supports multiple accessibility guidelines and we have completed draft 
        versions of Section 508 and the pending WCAG 2 HTML guidelines. Users 
        can now log in to the system to make decisions regarding potential accessibility 
        problems in their files.</p>
      <h4>Query Protocol Adapter for TILE</h4>
        <p>This deliverable is dependent on collaboration with other CANARIE funded 
        repository projects. Discussions have begun regarding communication and 
        exchange of content packages with the Edusource project.</p>
      <h4>Conduct a Community Kitchen Event in the Maritimes</h4>
        
      <p>A TILE Potluck and Community Kitchen event was successfully conducted 
        in Fredericton. A summary of the event can be found at: <a href="http://barrierfree.ca/tile/potluck3/index.html" class="inline">http://barrierfree.ca/tile/potluck3/index.html</a>. 
      </p>
      
      <h4>Complete ABEL implementation of Barrierfree Tools</h4>
     <p> Modification of the Barrierfree Tools for the ABEL project was completed. 
      The Barrierfree Tools are now available on the ABEL server for implementation 
      by the ABEL partner schools. IP permissions and associated issues were successfully 
      resolved.</p>
<h4>Content</h4>
        <p>Content completion was delayed in anticipation of a finalized Metadata 
        specification. Following notification by CANARIE, content partners have 
        begun to finalize the content Metadata using the draft specification. 
        The following is a synopsis of the progress made by various partners during 
        Q4 2003 with respect to the provision of content for the TILE project:
      <h4>Transitional Year Program (TYP) Content</h4>
       <p> Work continued on Cancore Metadata (with extensions) mark up for this 
        content. We have begun experimenting with IMS packaging and sequencing, 
        and have loaded the content into WebCT for use by TYP programs. </p>
      <h4>National Adult Literacy Database (NALD)</h4>
        <p>As reported earlier, Cancore Metadata (with extensions) templates have 
        been constructed for this content, and some Metadata has been assembled. 
        IMS packaging has been started. </p>
      <h4>Centre of Excellence for Research on Immigration and Settlement (CERIS)</h4>
        <p>Cancore Metadata (with extensions) has been constructed/assembled for 
        some CERIS content. An initial IMS packaging sequence has been selected, 
        with further work to come based on the extensive content under discussion.</p>
      <h4>Frontier College </h4>
        <p>Frontier College&#8217;s Literacy Tutor Guide has been digitized for inclusion 
        into the TILE repository. Work on Metadata preparation for this content 
        has begun, which will enable Frontier College&#8217;s valuable literacy 
        resource to be fully integrated into the TILE repository once it is completed. </p>
     
      <h4>Ryerson</h4>
      <h3> Accessibility</h3>
      <p>The tools group has reviewed the detailed Cancore Metadata (with extensions) 
        prepared for TILE content from Joe Clark&#8217;s book on Accessibility 
        to determine strategies to take advantage of the highly granular detail 
        provided.</h3>
      <h3>Community Access and Technology</h3>
        <p>Content for the thirteen-week course on Community Access and Technology, 
        is being formatted for implementation using IMS Content Packaging Metadata 
        (with extensions). This will allow for seamless integration into the TILE 
        repository environment. Prototype IMS Content Package metadata has been 
        prepared and tested. Meetings occurred between staff at the ATRC and staff 
        at Ryerson who are involved in Cancore Metadata (with extensions) preparation 
        using the template the ATRC has provided. </p>
      <h4>SNOW</h4>
        <p>Authoring of content has been started for the final SNOW workshop module 
        on the topic of the rich media and presentation of alternative formats 
        using emerging technologies. Testing has been completed for use of IMS 
        Content Packaging to ensure interoperability between the current SNOW 
        courseware tool, ATutor, and the TILE repository. Planning and development 
        of strategies for reuse of content from other partners has occurred.</p>
      <h4>Canadian Learning Television (CLT)</h4>
        <p>Communications with Canadian Learning Television on the topic of intellectual 
        property rights and the use of commercially available streamed videos 
        for e-learning has continued. Work in this area is challenging, as current 
        standards of practice within the educational video market are somewhat 
        incompatible with the notions of reusability and unlimited access inherent 
        in learning object repositories. CLT and the ATRC have examined several 
        models of intellectual property management (within an online environment) 
        including MIT&#8217;s Open Courseware model, and that of Alberta&#8217;s 
        CAREO project, in an effort to draft a policy which addresses the TILE 
        project&#8217;s need for versatility while still providing content developers 
        with IP security. The ATRC will continue to work with CLT on addressing 
        video intellectual property rights through development of an appropriate 
        IP policy for video-based content.</p>
      <h4> Digital Frog International (DFI)</h4>
        <p>Since October of 2003 Digital Frog International&#8217;s Science Matrix 
        has been available for free download from DFI&#8217;s web site. Since 
        then, Science Matrix has been downloaded more than 2000 times by educators 
        and students interested in science based e-content. <br>
        In December 2003, DFI was presented with a World Summit Award for the 
        Best in E-Content for their Science Matrix module The Cell, developed 
        for use in the TILE repository. The prestigious award was presented to 
        DFI at a gala in Geneva in early December as part of the World Summit 
        on the Information Society 2003. This award speaks to the high degree 
        of innovation and creativity inherent in DFI&#8217;s e-content, and recognizes 
        them as a world leader in this field. More information about this award 
        can be found at http://www.europrix.org/wsis-award/<br>
        Some development problems were encountered by DFI in the last quarter, 
        including some bugs in third party software they have been using to develop 
        the content for Science Matrix, but they have largely been resolved and 
        development work continues. The next module to be released for Science 
        Matrix will be the Assessment module. This second module is intended to 
        provide teachers with the tools to customise any one of four assessment 
        templates, including multiple choice, short answer, matching, and fill 
        in the blanks formats for use with DFI&#8217;s digital content. This module 
        will enable teachers to design their own assessments for students to undertake 
        when evaluating content they have learned from DFI&#8217;s Science Matrix. 
        <p>A third Science Matrix module is expected shortly, and will address the 
        links between the historical development of the technology used to view 
        cells and the increased understanding of cell structure imparted by those 
        technological advancements.</p>
      <h4>Complete TV program on the topic of TILE</h4>
        <p>CLT has completed a half hour documentary on TILE and the TILE Potlucks. 
        This program has been aired several times on CLT.</p>
