        <h2>REPORT 
          ON CAPTIONING POTLUCK</h2>
        <p> Ryerson 
          Polytechnic University, March 5, 2004</p>
        <p class="bold">Theme: 
          &#8220;Captioning&#8221;</p>
        <p>A &#8220;virtual&#8221; 
          community kitchen event took place on March 5, 2004 as Ryerson Polytechnic 
          University hosted an online conference to discuss current issues in 
          captioning. The &#8220;Captioning Potluck&#8221; offered the caption 
          providers, broadcasters, experts and consumers a place to share ideas. 
          The conference was held online, in the form of a chat, to facilitate 
          schedules of the participants, allowing everyone to join the discussions 
          in accordance with their interests and convenience.</p>
        <p>The potluck 
          commenced with a speech by Gary Malkowski, the Vice-President, Consumer, 
          , Government and Corporate Relations at The Canadian Hearing Society. 
          Gary&#8217;s speech was broadcasted live through the web. The rest of 
          the conference consisted of four main sessions:</p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <div class="title">
        <p> Approximately 
          twenty people participated in the four main sessions, including representatives 
          from WGBH/NCAM, Canadian Hearing Society, University of Toronto, Ryerson 
          University, Canadian Learning Television (CHUM City), Automatic Sync 
          Technologies and others from the Captioning industry.</p>
        <p>The Sharing 
          session was used as a warm-up and introduction to the conference. Since 
          the chat was not centered on one specific area, various issues were 
          discussed. One of the key topics of discussion was the user study conducted 
          by National Captioning Institute Foundation in December, 2003 about 
          the current quality of captioning (<a href="http://ncicap.org/AnnenbergStudy.asp" class="indexside">http://ncicap.org/AnnenbergStudy.asp</a>).</p>
        <p>Another 
          topic of discussion was the emergence of Digital Television and its 
          affect captioning. Other areas of interest were WGBH Enhanced Arthur 
          project, literacy level of caption users and how accessibility requirements 
          in North America compare to the U.K. <br>
          The second session on the agenda was Online Captioning. This session 
          benefited greatly from having Larry Goldberg of WGBH/NCAM as a participant, 
          since a lot of the chat was around WGBH involvement in online captioning 
          of streamed video content. Other topics of discussion were broadcasters&#8217; 
          unwillingness to provide online captioning, available captioning software, 
          and post-production versus during production captioning.</p>
        <p> The New 
          Technologies portion of the conference was dominated by possibilities 
          presented by Digital Television in regards to captioning. There was 
          a short dialogue about the possibility that DTV&#8217;s picture-in-picture 
          capabilities could allow for ASL translations of programming, although 
          it was rendered unlikely. This session also allowed for an in-depth 
          chat about some captioning software available in the market.</p>
        <p> The last 
          main session of the conference was Advocacy, or a mechanism for consumer 
          complaints and issues to be addressed without something as drastic as 
          a lawsuit every time. The majority of this chat session concerned the 
          FCC and the CRTC and how consumers should be encouraged to voice themselves.</p>
