<h2>REPORT 
          ON FIRST COMMUNITY POTLUCK</h2>
        <p> Wendy Porch<br />
          February 28, 2003</p>
      </div>
      <p class="bold">Theme: "Shaping Content"</p>
      <p>On February 28, 2003, 
        participants gathered at the University of Toronto for the first of four 
        TILE Community Potluck events coordinated by the Adaptive Technology Resource 
        Centre (ATRC). Community potlucks are slated to occur once every quarter 
        and are intended to provide partners and those interested in e-learning 
        from the larger community the opportunity to collaborate and exchange 
        information related to learning object repositories, transformable content 
        and their impact on e-learning. </p>
      <p>Representatives from 
        the ATRC, Canadian Learning Television, Trent University, Ryerson University 
        and University of Guelph's Universal Instructional Design Project were 
        among those participating in the potluck. Jutta Treviranus, director of 
        the ATRC, presented participants with an introduction to the activities 
        for the day, and oriented participants to the theme of the potluck "Shaping 
        Content" through a thought provoking presentation. She challenged participants 
        to explore the idea of reusable, transformable e-learning content. She 
        asked participants to consider questions such as "How small could a learning 
        object be and still be useful?" and "What is important to know about re-shaping 
        existing content to meet new needs?" She further elaborated the idea of 
        reusability in learning objects through a vivid example utilizing toy 
        Lego blocks, illustrating that each block could be used together with 
        other blocks in innumerable custom combinations to build unique end products. 
        The TILE project's learning repository will incorporate the authoring 
        tools, repository architecture, and preference schema needed to support 
        assembling learning objects to create content across multiple contexts, 
        according to the learners' needs and preferences. </p>
      <p>Partners then made 
        progress reports, as did the technical and administrative staff from the 
        ATRC. Project partners present reported on efforts made to identify suitable 
        candidates for transformable content to be used as learning objects in 
        the TILE repository. Anastasia Cheetham, the project's technical lead, 
        also provided participants with an overview of technical achievements 
        and challenges so far in the project. ATRC technical staff have been making 
        great progress in their development of the authoring tools, repository 
        architecture, and preference schema deliverables for the project. </p>
      <p>As the theme of this 
        first community potluck was "Shaping Content" participants in attendance 
        took part in a learning exercise aimed at introducing those present to         the idea of shaping content using learning objects. Participants were 
        asked ahead of time to supply an ingredient to a potluck "dish" in the 
        form of a learning object related to the topic of time management. Learning 
        objects provided by participants ranged from simple text-based articles 
        on the topic of time management to web-based study time calculators to 
        a video taped episode of Help TV focussed on assisting people to better 
        manage their time. Participants were then split up into groups, with each 
        group supplied with a basket of the ingredients and instructions to develop 
        an online learning module using the objects provided. By way of providing 
        some instruction and focus, groups were given a short learning template 
        that provided instructional design hints suggesting they define their 
        audience first, and develop some overall learning objectives. However, 
        the specifics of the content's design and use were up to the groups to 
        determine on their own. </p>
      <p>After receiving instructions 
        for the exercise, participants split off into their small groups and began 
        development. Present in each of the groups were participant observers 
        who were also using the exercise as a way to extract information about 
        how people approach this type of problem in order to inform the design 
        of the project's deliverables. The groups worked collaboratively to identify 
        their particular audiences' characteristics, learning objectives and learning 
        outcomes. They then developed a skeleton format for their time management 
        module using the learning objects provided. After lunch, a representative 
        from each of the four groups presented their time management module designs 
        to the larger group. </p>
      <p>The results of this 
        potluck exercise were surprising in both their diversity and level of 
        sophistication. All of the groups employed at least five of the common 
        learning objects, but to varying ends and applications. Each group individually 
        developed different intended audiences, different learning objectives 
        and different methods of integrating the learning objects provided. For 
        example, one group developed an online time management workshop entitled 
        "Time Management for Undergraduates", while another's was entitled "An 
        Introduction to Time Management "A course for busy professionals!" To 
        view the results of this exercise, please see the list below:</p>

          </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This collaborative 
        content development exercise provided those present with a hands-on example 
        of how the same learning objects can easily be re-purposed to suit different 
        learner needs and contexts. On a much larger scale, the TILE Learning 
        Objects Repository will provide educators/content developers with the 
        opportunity to re-use and adapt a range of learning objects to best meet 
        the needs of their particular learners. </p>
      <p>For the remainder 
        of the afternoon, discussion centred on issues raised by the potluck exercise. 
        One key question posed by many of the participants related to the degree 
        of granularity one could potentially break learning objects into. One 
        group suggested that the base unit of the learning object repository be 
        termed "a tile", with the possibility that within one large learning object 
        there could be multiple smaller "tiles'. Each tile could then be connected 
        to and built upon in combination with any of the other tiles available 
        in the learning object repository. Interoperability and reusability of 
        learning objects would enable educator/designers to access a much larger 
        pool of stored educational information and resources. This sharing and 
        interoperability of learning objects by online educators is one of the 
        key intentions of the TILE project. </p>
      <p>As learning objects 
        would be submitted by "authors" and then potentially customized or reused, 
        the afternoon discussion also explored the development of a tracking system 
        for learning objects. Such a system may potentially record who was the 
        original author of a particular learning object, when it was been submitted 
        and what changes, if any, were made by subsequent users of the material. 
        The ATRC's technical team is currently exploring the feasibility of developing 
        such a system. </p>
      <p>The TILE Community 
        Potluck raised several significant points for further exploration and 
        development while simultaneously providing project participants with a 
        first-hand view of the benefits of reusable transformable e-learning content. 
        Canadian Learning Television was on hand filming this TILE community potluck 
        event for use in a television spot about the project to be aired at a 
        later date. We will provide airing details for this material when they 
        are made available. </p>
      <p>Plans are 
        in the works for our next community potluck event. Watch the TILE web 
        site for more information. </p>
