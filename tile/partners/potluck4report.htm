        <h2>REPORT 
          ON FOURTH COMMUNITY POTLUCK</h2>
        <p> The Inclusive 
          Learning Exchange (TILE) Community Potluck Event, University of Toronto 
          - March 29, 2004</p>
        <p>Robert 
          Luke, ATRC</p>
        <p class="bold">Theme: Pulling it all together</p>
        <p>The fourth 
          and final TILE Community Potluck was held at the University of Toronto 
          on 29 March 2004. Community Potlucks have been held each quarter over 
          the year long development cycle. They are intended to get participant 
          input into the design and development of the TILE tools, as well as 
          to show people how and why TILE works. These events have been crucial 
          to the overall participatory design process of the TILE project. The 
          Potlucks have enabled the research and development team to engage with 
          participants and project partners throughout the design cycle, and obtain 
          feedback on functional specifications and other design issues. This 
          iterative and cooperative prototyping of the TILE application has resulted 
          in measurable and meaningful impact on the overall development of TILE.</p>
        <p>In attendance 
          at the final Potluck were people from across the University of Toronto 
          faculties, Ryerson University, York University, Canadian Learning Television, 
          and others. All participants shared a concern with inclusive e-learning. 
          The theme for this event was &#8220;Pulling it all together,&#8221; 
          and it was intended as a capstone to the entire developmental year. 
          </p>
        <p>The day 
          got under way with an update and overview of TILE by Jutta Treviranus, 
          director of the ATRC. Jutta posited a new definition of disability as 
          being a mismatch between a learner and the learning environment, and 
          asked participants to think about how e-learning can be used to enable 
          unforeseen educational opportunities to emerge. By allowing learners 
          to engage within educational environments that are adaptable to the 
          particular constraints of disabilities, we are able to open up educational 
          possibilities to wider audiences. </p>
        <p>A Community 
          Activity was then conducted with four breakout groups. Each group was 
          given a topic area, and, with the help of an ATRC staff facilitator, 
          asked to use the TILE tool to create a custom learning package. Each 
          group was asked to construct a learning path that included ancillary 
          learning materials that are alternatives to specific content. That is, 
          group members were able to construct learning paths of various multimedia, 
          and add in alternative content &#8211; text descriptions of graphics 
          and videos, for example. These kinds of learner supports can enable 
          people who need alternative information displays to see the media of 
          their preference. </p>
        <p>The purpose 
          of the group activity was to explore the user interface developed by 
          the TILE programming team, learn how to upload content to the repository 
          and to search the repository for existing resources, to develop a sample 
          module by specifying learning objectives, and associating resources 
          with those objectives, and to publish a learning module to the TILE 
          repository. This activity created a backdrop for discussion of next 
          steps to further develop support for the reuse of learning objects. 
          </p>
        <p>Each group&#8217;s 
          facilitator kept notes on the groups as part of a field observational 
          approach to ascertaining how well the TILE application worked on the 
          one hand, and where there were gaps in the design and usability on the 
          other. Many useful suggestions were gathered. These were shared in a 
          large group forum comprised of all Potluck participants. This discussion 
          of developmental issues, design flaws and technological tricks was augmented 
          by a thorough discussion of how well the tool worked and where specific 
          improvement was necessary. A discussion about the larger context of 
          designing e-learning with tools like TILE generated very fruitful discussion 
          about many facets of e-learning that currently dominate discussions 
          about the use of new technologies in education more generally. These 
          issues included Intellectual Property (IP) and copyright issues, reusability, 
          collaborative and iterative learning object design, the role of quality 
          assurance and accuracy, as well as instructional design issues and assumptions 
          that play a role in the design and development of meaningful learning 
          objects and activities. </p>
        <p>Instructional 
          design and the role of evaluation were recurring themes in the Potluck. 
          There was some discussion about how learning activities can be constructed 
          among learning materials within the TILE interface. Incorporating interaction 
          and activity templates was seen as a potentially effective way to enable 
          instructors (particularly novice e-learning developers) to construct 
          meaningful online learning that can accommodate various abilities. The 
          larger instructional context was thus foregrounded as an important location 
          or reference for those who work on putting online materials together. 
          There was general agreement that a tool like TILE could be of enourmous 
          benefit in meeting the needs of diverse learners, provided that there 
          was adequate user support in conjunction with teaching potential users 
          of TILE what inclusive authoring can mean for students. That is, instructional 
          design and technical support for people using the TILE authoring tool 
          would form a necessary context in which its use could be fully explored.</p>
        <p>The discussion 
          ended with many specific recommendations for re-engineering TILE to 
          better suit the needs of instructors. The day was an invaluable for 
          getting input into the functional specifications of TILE. The general 
          discussion was fruitful for enabling a clearer articulation of the TILE 
          goals with the actual software use; this was the first time participants 
          were asked to actually use TILE, an as such the event was very good 
          for getting structured feedback on usability and design issues. </p>
        <p>The day 
          ended with a presentation by Jutta to the Learning Object Summit at 
          the National Research Council&#8217;s Institute for Information Technology, 
          via interactive Internet webcast. Several TILE Potluck attendees participated 
          in this broadcast. Jutta presented some of the direct results of the 
          day&#8217;s action research into the use of inclusive authoring tools. 
          </p>
        <p>The implications for learners are great for the TILE application. The 
          final Potluck was another effective step in an iterative development 
          cycle that is responsive to the needs of those who design and develop 
          inclusive online education. </p>
