          ON SECOND COMMUNITY POTLUCK</h2>

        <p>Presentation 
          by Jutta Treviranus (PPT Format) </p>
        <p>On June 
          19, 2003, participants gathered at the University of Calgary Learning 
          Commons for the second of four TILE Community Potlucks coordinated by 
          the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC). The TILE project would 
          like to express our appreciation to the Alberta Online Consortium for 
          their role in organizing this event. Community potlucks are slated to 
          occur once every quarter and are intended to provide partners and those 
          interested in e-learning from the larger community the opportunity to 
          collaborate and exchange information related to learning object repositories, 
          transformable content and their impact on e-learning. </p>
        <p>The Calgary 
          potluck included representatives from the ATRC, Canadian Learning Television, 
          University of Calgary, Athabasca, Argyll Project as well as front line 
          teachers and other educators who specialize in e-learning. Jutta Treviranus, 
          director for the ATRC, gave a presentation that provided participants 
          with an overview of the day's activities as well as a framework for 
          understanding the theme of the potluck, &#8220;Customizing Content.&#8221; 
          Participants were asked to consider &#8220;What kind of learning activity 
          structures can be reused?&#8221;, &#8220;How generic can the learning 
          activities be?&#8221;, &#8220;How much can we modularize?&#8221; and 
          &#8220;What supports do educators need?&#8221;</p>
        <p>With these 
          questions in mind, participants broke out into groups lead by the ATRC 
          participants. Each group worked together on an activity that explored 
          the concept of customizing content. Each group was asked to create nine 
          learning activities through a process that changed content but not the 
          activity or that changed the activity but not the content. In this way, 
          the groups were able to consider and try re-purposing of content and 
          learning structures.</p>
        <p>In the 
          afternoon, each group presented their learning activities to the other 
          participants and discussion followed each work. Some of the themes that 
          arose were as follows:</p>
        <p>Support: 
          Teachers require support for any technology successfully implemented. 
          How can this support be provided? Various types of suggestions were 
          made from teaching information technology in pre-service to requiring           that teachers undertake continuing education in learning object repositories 
          and related technology. These suggestion raised further questions around 
          incentives; it was thought that time strapped teachers would require 
          incentive to produce learning objects and upload them to repositories.</p>
        <p>Rights: 
          Who owns learning objects that are made on teacher&#8217;s off hours? 
          Alberta has recently said that even if it was created in off hours that 
          it is possession of board not teacher. What is the impact of this decision?</p>
        <p>Object 
          Information: Reading levels need to be addressed and teachers need this 
          information to make choices from learning object repositories. Learning 
          outcomes need be stated in the repository browser tool.</p>
        <p>Granularity: 
          Do we separate images from text in the LOR to enable accommodation of 
          different reading levels and/or language skills?</p>
        <p>Relevance: 
          Curriculum correlations for materials in the LOR are important; who 
          would update these are requirements change. Teachers said relevancy 
          would be integral to the successful use of LOR. Maintenance is important 
          so that content in the LOR retains usefulness and relevancy.</p>
        <p>During 
          the closing discussion, the participants agreed that the day&#8217;s 
          exercise offered proof that content could effectively be re-used, however, 
          one teacher posed a question about the learning templates: if content 
          is stripped from learning templates don&#8217;t they all just become 
          so generic that they all seem the same? Is there a danger of this happening?</p>
        <p>Overall, 
          the participants gave great support for theory of reusability of learning 
          objects through repository although questions remain regarding support, 
          training, incentives to participate, rights questions, training. </p>
        <p>The TILE 
          Community Potluck raised several significant points for further exploration 
          and development and provided opportunity to test out some of the ideas 
          around customizing content. Canadian Learning Television was on hand 
          filming this TILE community potluck event for use in a television spot 
          about the project to be aired at a later date. We will provide airing 
          details for this material when they are made available. </p>
