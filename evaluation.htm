      <h3><a name="1"></a>Formative Evaluation for Broadband Accessibility Study</h3>
      <p>The purpose of the formative evaluation component is to obtain user input 
        during the development process through a simple methodology with results 
        that will inform design (i.e. problems, sources of error, barriers to 
        access, learnability). The evaluation team is undertaking an analysis 
        of the entire project and providing relevant feedback to the tools development 
        team. Specific evaluation protocols for evaluating player, editor functionality 
        and user interface are to be utilized. Activities are as follows:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>For usability testing video documentation is utilized. Short fifteen-minute 
          clips of users performing representative tasks will be analyzed. </li>
        <li>Heuristic evaluation using Jakob Nielson&#146;s methodology is based 
          on expert users evaluation of design based on prescribed usability heuristics, 
          with specific focus on disability issues for each heuristic.<br>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <h3><a name="2"></a>ASL Video Evaluation:</h3>
      <p>A portion of the evaluation for this project has looked at the addition 
        of an American Sign Language (ASL) video translation of an existing educational 
        video and video setting preferences of individuals who use ASL for communication. 
        The objectives of this evaluation were: </p>
      <ol>
        <li>to determine what enhancements to ASL translation are effective to 
          viewers</li>
        <li>to examine the effects of different ASL presentation formats on learning</li>
        <li>to inform design of courseware software</li>
      </ol>
      <p>In order to accomplish these objectives, the team presented ASL-speaking 
        participants with two different ASL versions of the same educational video, 
        <i>The Law</i>, from the <i>Room for Five</i> series. One of the videos 
        was a direct interpretation of the law video to ASL while the other video 
        was an acted ASL interpretation of the video. Our goal was to see if learners 
        preferred one format over the other and to see if either format had an 
        effect on their learning. </p>
      <p>Our participants were also provided opportunity to arrange the ASL and 
        original video appearance through settings options. These options allowed 
        the viewer to make one video window larger than the other video window, 
        to set the position of the two videos relative to each other (i.e. top, 
        bottom, side, near, far) and to choose to place borders around the video 
        windows. </p>
      <p>Participants provided information to the evaluation team through pre 
        and post questionnaires, signed feedback and test scores. Additional sources 
        of information to the team include video tapes of the sessions and key-stroke 
        data that records use of the video controls by the participant. </p>
      <p>With the help of experimenters and translators from the Canadian Hearing 
        Society, we have been able to collect the relevant data and are in the 
        process of analyzing the information that has been collected. Test scores 
        show no trend towards better learning with either type of translation, 
        however all of the data must be examined before the potential effect of 
        each option is fully understood. At the completion of the analysis we 
        expect to have a better idea of the kind of ASL adaptation that is most 
        cost-effective and valuable to learners. We also expect that the design 
        of the learner interface will reflect the needs and preferences of learners 
        who are deaf particularly with regards to the degree of control the learner 
        will have over video size and positioning. </p>

      <h3><a name="3"></a>Summary of Interface Evaluation Activities: </h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Two different ASL versions of the Room for Five learning video were 
          produced with CHS and Marble Media. The first version is acted ASL where 
          the ASL equivalent of the video is provided by actors. The second version 
          is an ASL interpretation of the video material.</li>
        <li>The team participated in the definition and specification of enhancements 
          required for the original physics video material.</li>
        <li>The team participated in defining and specifying the user interface 
          requirements for the editor and player.</li>
        <li>An evaluation template to evaluate the various ASL video production 
          methods was designed and an ethics application was submitted.</li>
        <li>Ethics approval was given to the evaluation process.</li>
        <li>Training materials were created and two experimenters were trained 
          to carry out the experiment: one experimenter in Sudbury and one in 
          Toronto.</li>
        <li>Sixteen ASL subjects completed the study.</li>
        <li>Data analysis of the ASL component has commenced</li>
        <li>The evaluation team will continue to monitor the literature and incorporate 
          new results into current work.</li>
        <li>Developed specific evaluation protocols for evaluating player, editor 
          functionality and user interface.</li>
        <li>Provided player interface feedback to developers in preparation for 
          planned usability evaluation

      <h2>Additional Evaluation Initiatives:</h2>
      <h3><a name="4"></a>Literature Review and Expert Survey</h3>
      <p>An expert survey on distance education practices, recommendations and 
        concern for accessibility of content has been undertaken. This process 
        includes inter-rater reliability of the survey data. A paper based on 
        the findings is being prepared.</p>
      <p>In addition, a literature review of distance education practices and 
        accommodations for accessibility has been completed. The evaluation team 
        are continuing to monitor the literature and incorporate new results into 
        current work and recommendations.</p>
