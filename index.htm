      <h2 align="left">Supports educators in creating and repurposing learning 
        content that is accessible to all learners. </h2>
      <h2 align="left">Provides learners with on-line curriculum that adapts to 
        their learning and access needs.</h2>
      <P align="left"> The Barrierfree toolset takes a story captured in linear 
        video and links a wealth of information, enhancements and perspectives 
        using a synchronized text track derived from the caption and audio description 
        of the video. This provides the viewer with a cohesive interactive experience 
        that is also accessible to people with hearing, visual and physical disabilities. 
        Thus the material becomes more than a collection of multimedia artifacts 
        but integral parts of a rich and multi-dimensional story.</P>
      <P align="left">The <a href="reports.htm"><strong>Barrierfree Tools</strong></a> 
        have been designed and developed with continuous input from learners and 
        educators. The tools have been tested on Mac OS 9, Mac OS X and Windows 
        and include:</P>
      <div align="left"> 
        <UL>
          <LI>an authoring tool for the educator to enrich video content and make 
            it interactive</LI>
          <LI>a player/browser for the learner to view and interact with the content</LI>
          <LI>a preference wizard for the learner to state how they wish to view 
            and control the learning content</LI>
          <LI>and a repository that stores, assembles and serves the learning 
            content according to the needs of the individual learner</LI>
        </UL>
      </div>
      <P align="left">Exemplary content that demonstrates the potential of the 
        learning environment has also been developed. </P>
      <H3 align="left">What's next?</H3>
      <P align="left">The Barrierfree Tools and environment is currently being 
        deployed within "ABEL", the <a href="http://www.abelearn.ca/"><strong>Advanced 
        Broadband Enabled Learning</strong></a> project led by York University. 
        As part of this endeavour, the Barrierfree user interface has been altered 
        to improve usability within the ABEL environment, based on user feedback 
        and testing. Support for an external streaming media server has been added 
        to the repository software. A tutorial demonstrating how to use the Barrier-Free 
        Editor is complete, and will be made available to the ABEL teachers along 
        with the software.</P>
      <P align="left">Another innovative project is <a href="http://barrierfree.ca/tile/index.htm"><strong>The 
        Inclusive Learning Exchange (TILE)</strong></a> which is taking learning 
        object respository technology to the next level by creating a repository 
        service that responds to the individual needs of the learner. TILE is 
        broadening the Barrierfree mission of advancing Internet e-learning functionality 
        for all learners including those with disabilities.</P>
