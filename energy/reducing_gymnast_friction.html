She is holding a plastic sleeve which is wrapped around the metal bar to reduce friction between the bar and her hands."></p>
      <p>To reduce friction between the hands of the gymnast and the bar a plastic 
        tube is used. The gymnast holds the tube firmly in her hands and the tube 
        slides over the metal bar. The friction between the plastic is significantly 
        less than what would be the friction between the gymnast's hands and the 
        bar.</p>
