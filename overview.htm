      <H2 align="left">Introduction</H2>
      <p align="left">The Internet offers a wealth of educational and recreational 
        learning material in the form of text and images. People with disabilities; 
        for example, people who are blind or physically disabled, are able to 
        overcome barriers to using these materials with the help of software and 
        hardware technologies which have evolved as the Internet has grown. The 
        spread of high-speed Internet is bringing with it websites rich in audio 
        and video. Educators are creating a wealth of exciting learning materials 
        using these technologies spurring an increased demand for tools which 
        will allow all people, including those with disabilities, to access the 
        material. </p>
      <p align="left">The transition to these broadband networks represents a 
        risk and an opportunity for people with disabilities. On the one hand, 
        broadband networks provide a flexible vehicle whereby innovative display 
        and control alternatives can be offered that afford access to users with 
        a range of skills and needs. The interactive mechanisms that will be available 
        over broadband networks will allow learners to customize the presentation 
        of the learning materials (the pacing, the order, the modality, etc) while 
        retaining a rich, engaging learning experience. Broadband will also allow 
        the transmission of multiple modalities synchronously (video, audio, haptics, 
        text, graphics), thereby accommodating learners who need alternative display 
        modalities or several display modalities at one time. </p>
      <p align="left">The risk presented by the move from restricted bandwidth 
        networks to broadband networks is that content developers lose an important 
        motivation to include equivalent alternatives to multimedia content. To 
        date, steps taken by content providers to accommodate users with bandwidth 
        restrictions, legacy browsers or mobile client software (eg, text alternatives, 
        no-frame options, structural markup, etc.) have also made the content 
        accessible to people with disabilities. To ensure that the move to broadband 
        networks does not exclude a large portion of Canadian learners, inclusive 
        tools and mechanisms need to be developed at the outset. </p>
      <p align="left">The overall goal of this project is to identify potential 
        barriers to access in broadband education delivery systems, develop solutions 
        to the barriers, advance alternative or multi-modal display and control 
        mechanisms that are only possible in broadband environments and create 
        tools that allow learners to customize the learning experience to their 
        individual learning styles and needs. </p>

      <p align="left">Learners who are presently excluded from using network based 
        educational environments due to access barriers include individuals of 
        all ages:</p>

            <div align="left">who are deaf and hard of hearing and rely on captioning

      <p align="left">Potential learners with disabilities make up more than 15% 
        of the Canadian population. This will increase in the next decade with 
        the effects of an aging population. Given a growing awareness and respect 
        for the human rights of people with disabilities worldwide and legislative 
        steps taken to insure access, there is a large market worldwide for barrier 
        free education tools. </p>

      <p align="left">The project team has broad sectorial and geographic representation. 
        The team draws together leaders in the field of academic technology access, 
        forerunners in national educational broadcasting, cutting-edge innovators 
        in information technology, and national consumer groups. The team members 
        represent university-based research programs, Canadian corporations, Canadian 
        Small Medium Enterprises and national public sector partners. The team 
        has the necessary participants and commitment to accurately identify the 
        barriers, develop innovative solutions, implement the solutions, market 
        the results to the educational market in Canada and abroad, and evaluate 
        the outcome.</p>

      <H2 align="left">Summary</H2>
      <p align="left">Development of broadband delivered education systems in 
        Canada is at a critical juncture: conventions can be established that 
        exclude a large sector of the Canadian population or conventions can be 
        adopted that make education possible for many Canadians who have been 
        previously excluded. If proactive steps are taken now, barrier-free education 
        can be a naturally integrated component of broadband education delivery.</p>
