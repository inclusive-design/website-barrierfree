<h1>Introduction</h1>

<p>The purpose of this document is to specify the desired
functionality of the various deliverables of the CANARIE project <a
href="http://www.barrierfree.ca">Creating Barrier-Free Broadband
Learning Environments</a>. This document will serve as a reference
for the technical team implementing the systems.</p>

<p>There are two 'classes' of intended users for this project:
learners, who are primarily users of the Player deliverable, and
educators, who are primarily users of the Authoring Tool
deliverable.</p>

<p>This document is presented in two sections. The first section
describes the intended users of the systems, indicating the
assumptions made regarding their abilities, and discussing the user
characteristics which drive the functional specifications. The
second section presents these specifications.</p>

<h1>Target Learners</h1>

<h2>Primary</h2>

<p>The primary learners being targeted by this project are learners
who are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Blind and low vision</li>

<li>Deaf and hard of hearing</li>

<li>Physical Disabilities</li>

<li>Learning Disabilities</li>
</ul>

<p>The systems will be designed to directly address the needs of
these groups.</p>

<h2>Secondary</h2>

<p>The secondary learners being targeted by this project are as
follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>English as a second language</li>

<li>Learners without disabilities</li>

<li>Deaf-blind</li>
</ul>

<p>The systems will not attempt to directly address the needs of
these groups, but effort will be made to avoid introducing new
barriers for these groups.</p>

<h2>Reading Level for Learners</h2>

<p>It is assumed that the target learners will have a minimum Grade
4 reading level.</p>

<h2>Content Type</h2>

<p>The content which will be used for evaluation of this project
will be as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Physics: first 2 clusters of "World in Motion" series, 10
videos initially</li>

<li>Humanities: the best 3 of "Room for Five"</li>
</ul>

<h2>Primary Barriers and Requirements for Learners</h2>

<p>The current primary barriers for learners are as follows:</p>

<p>For deaf/hard of hearing learners:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of captioned content</li>

<li>lack of readable captions</li>

<li>identification of speaker</li>

<li>understanding language used</li>

<li>understanding vocabulary used</li>

<li>understanding concepts used</li>

<li>speed of content/captions</li>
</ul>

<p>For blind/low vision learners:</p>

<ul>
<li>Math notation, Science notation, Geography maps, accounting
charts</li>
</ul>

<p>Text to speech products have great difficulty with graphics
environments (diagrams, charts, maps, etc.). When reading charts,
it is sometimes difficult to read columns without a previous
knowledge of how they should look.&nbsp; Also, alignment is most
important with charts, and this has to be made clear to persons who
are unable to see what the charts really look like.</p>

<h2>Goals for Learners</h2>

<p>The tasks that we want the learners to achieve with our
curriculum and with our tools are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>Success understanding the content</li>

<li>Greater academic success</li>

<li>Easy use of tool</li>

<li>Obtain support for using the tools</li>

<li>For blind/low vision learners: obtain adequate descriptions of
visual material</li>
</ul>

<h1>Target Educators</h1>

<p>There are two types of target educators: the original content
creators, and 'modifiers' who refine the content created by the
content creators for their own purposes. The first group would
include content developers and web designers. The second group
would include teachers, students and captioners.</p>

<h2>Technical Proficiency of Educators</h2>

<p>It is assumed that the target educators will be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Web browsing literate</li>

<li>Have word processing skills</li>

<li>Have an awareness of students' needs</li>

<li>Be technically savvy, and motivated</li>
</ul>

<h2>Primary Barriers and Requirements for Educators</h2>

<p>The current primary barriers for educators are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>lack of support for creating content for multiple types and
levels of learners</li>

<li>lack of support for making "readable" captions</li>

<li>lack of support for transcribing and insertion of captions</li>

<li>lack of support for importing line 21 captioned content</li>

<li>lack of support for different skill levels of creators</li>
</ul>

<h2>Goals for Educators</h2>

<p>The tasks that we want the educators to achieve with our tools
are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>create enhanced interactive content that includes hyperlinking
captions</li>

<li>address the varying needs of learners</li>

<li>ease of use of authoring tools</li>
</ul>

<h1>Functional Requirements</h1>

<p>This section describes the desired functionality from the user
perspective (learner or educator, as appropriate), in terms of both
the content itself, and the interface with the content. The desired
functionality of the Player drives the functional requirements of
the Authoring Tool.</p>

<h2><a name="_content"></a>1 Content</h2>

<p>This project involves enhancing digitized videos with various
forms of learning objects including text captions, audio
descriptions, and more. Several types of information will be
presented to the learner:<br>
&nbsp;</p>

<dl>
<dt>Main video</dt>

<dd>In most cases, this is the original video-based learning
material.</dd>

<dt>Captions</dt>

<dd>A verbatim text caption will be the base alternative format for
the learning material. Alternatives to the verbatim caption may
also be available, such as reduced reading level captions or
alternate languages. For more information, see the section on <a
href="#_textcaptions">Captions</a>.</dd>

<dt>Audio descriptions</dt>

<dd>Audio descriptions of the visual elements of the video will
also be available. Like the text captions, different types of audio
descriptions will be available, such as didactic and descriptive.
For more information, see the section on <a href=
"#_audiodesc">Audio Descriptions</a>.</dd>

<dt>Sign translation</dt>

<dd>A sign translation video image will be available. This may
possibly consist of multiple images, if necessary to convey
multiple speakers, etc.</dd>

<dt>Markers</dt>

<dd>Graphical overlays may be used by the author to draw the
learner's attention to particular areas of the visual image or
text.</dd>

<dt>Graphics</dt>

<dd>In addition to graphical overlays for highlighting purposes,
other graphical images may be presented if deemed appropriate by
the content author.</dd>

<dt>Annotations</dt>

<dd>The author/educator may add text annotations to the material to
provide a form of commentary on the lecture. For learners with
visual impairments, these annotations can be spoken aloud.</dd>

<dt>Other</dt>

<dd>Other, as yet defined information may be added as well.</dd>
</dl>

<p>
Some of these media types are described in more detail below.</p>

<h3><a name="_textcaptions"></a>1.1 Captions</h3>

<p>Captions provide a non-auditory alternative to the audio portion
of a video. Learners will be able to choose from alternative
versions of text captions. Possibilities include (but are not
limited to) the following:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Verbatim caption</li>

<li>Speed-Reduced caption</li>

<li>Modified Reading Level caption</li>

<li>Multilingual versions of the above types of captions</li>

<li>Other</li>
</ol>

<p>In some cases, multiple versions of a type of caption may be
used. For example, if the original audio is in English, there will
be only one verbatim caption, in English, but there may be several
multilingual captions, each in a different language. Similarly,
several different reading level captions may be used. See the
section entitled <a href="#_usercontrol">Learner Controls</a> for
information on learner selection of captions.</p>

<p>Text captions will be able to include graphical images, and
hyperlinks to other material (see the section entitled <a href=
"#_links">Hyperlinks</a> for more details).</p>

<p>The presentation of text captions will be defined by the content
author using the <a href="#_authprefs">Authoring Tool</a>, and will
to some extent be configurable by the learner using the <a href=
"#_usercontrol">Player</a>. The presentation features which will be
configurable are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Background</li>

<ul>
<li>Shading</li>

<li>Transparency/opaque and colour options</li>

<li>No background</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Background shape</li>

<ul>
<li>Standard rectangle edit box</li>

<li>Text background wraps to text on each line (TV broadcast pop-up
captions)</li>

<li>Speech bubble and other shapes</li>
</ul>
</li>

<li>Font face (all available fonts including non-latin fonts)</li>

<li>Font size, style, colour</li>
</ul>

<p>
<a name="_captionposition"></a>Text captions will appear in one of
several preset positions in the Player window:</p>

<ol type="a">
<li>Outside of the video frame of the movie container window.&nbsp;
For instance, in the black border below, above or to the side of
the video frame.</li>

<li>Inside of the video frame of the movie container window</li>

<li>Overlapping the video frame of the movie container window</li>

<li>In an HTML-based text field outside of the movie container
window</li>

<li>In an HTML-based scrollable caption storage field outside of
the movie container window.&nbsp; This window accumulates all the
captions for the video.&nbsp; The caption storage field contents
may be selected and copied to clipboard.&nbsp; The contents of this
field may also be saved as a file.</li>
</ol>

<p>More information on learner control of the positioning and
formatting of captions is presented in the section entitled <a
href="#_usercontrol">Learner Controls</a>.</p>

<h3><a name="_audiodesc"></a>1.2 Audio Descriptions</h3>

<p>Audio descriptions provide non-visual alternatives to the visual
content of the video. The following types of audio descriptions
will be predefined:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Standard</dt>

<dd>This description will contain a typical audio description of
the visual elements, designed to fit into the quiet times of the
video.</dd>

<dt>Expanded</dt>

<dd>This description will contain a typical audio description of
the visual elements, but will not be limited in length to the
available quiet time (see further explanation <a href=
"#_auddescexpl">below</a>).</dd>

<dt>Multilingual versions of the above types of descriptions</dt>

<dd>These descriptions would contain, to the extent possible, the
same content as those described above, but in alternative
languages.</dd>
</dl>

<p>Two further classifications of audio description will also be
possible:</p>

<dl>
<dt>Didactic</dt>

<dd>This description will contain the strictly educational content
of the visual scene, that is, a description of only (and all) that
which is necessary to understand the intended educational
lesson.</dd>

<dt>Extra</dt>

<dd>This description will contain any extra description, not
contained in the didactic description, which might be appropriate,
such as descriptions of the scene, the appearance of the
characters, etc.</dd>
</dl>

<a name="_auddescexpl"></a>
<p>The expanded version of the audio description will not be edited
to fit into the quiet time available in the original audio.&nbsp;
Presentation of this content will be carried out in one of two
ways, based on the learner's preference:</p>

<ul>
<li>the original material will automatically be paused while the
audio description plays, and playback will resume automatically
once the audio description is complete; or</li>

<li>the learner will be informed of the presence of additional
audio description by an audio tone, and may opt to pause the
original playback to listen to the audio description if they
desire.</li>
</ul>

<h3><a name="_annotations"></a>1.3 Annotations</h3>

<p>Annotations are very similar to text captions, except that they
will typically be composed by the teacher, and serve to provide
supplementary information, as opposed to alternative formats of the
primary information. Characteristics such as font features and
screen positioning are the same as those for captions.</p>

<h3><a name="_links"></a>1.4 Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>Any text in a text caption or annotation, or any graphical
image, can be a hyperlink. Unlike traditional web-based hyperlinks,
caption hyperlinks will have up to four types of information
associated with them:</p>

<ol>
<li>Definition</li>
<dl>
<dd>a text definition of the word or phrase</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li>Interactive exercise</li>
<dl>
<dd>an interactive exercise designed to illustrate a concept or
idea</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li>Background information</li>
<dl>
<dd>text presentation of related information which may be helpful
in understanding the word or phrase</dd>
</dl>
</li>

<li>Related link(s)</li>
<dl>
<dd>hypertext link(s) to web page(s) containing material related to
the word or phrase</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ol>

<p>
A hyperlink may also be used to take the learner to another
location in the presentation.</p>

<p>Information about the presentation and activation of hyperlinks
is provided in the Player section on <a href=
"#_hyperlinks">hyperlinks</a>.</p>

<h2>2 Player</h2>

<p>The Player is the interface through which the learner interacts
with the educational material.</p>

<h3>2.1 Layout</h3>

<p>The educational material contains several types of media, from
video to text to graphics. The Player will control the layout of
this information on the screen, and process the learner's
interaction with the material.</p>

<p>Through the Player, the learner will be able to select which of
the available forms of <a href="#_content">content</a> they wish to
view, as well as the format used to present this information (see
<a href="#_usercontrol">Learner Controls</a> for more information).
As well, other information will be presented in the Player window
if the learner chooses. These include:</p>

<ul>
<li>the full caption text, presented in a separate area of the
screen,</li>

<li>a full list of all links contained in the caption,</li>

<li>the author's annotations,</li>

<li>the learner's own notes (see <a href="#_notes">Learner
Notes</a> for more information on learner notes),</li>

<li>indication of where in the lecture the learner is currently
(e.g. title/section etc),</li>

<li>navigational controls</li>
</ul>

<h3>2.2 Navigation</h3>

<p>The learner will have the ability to navigate the video
presentation. Specifically, learners will be able to:</p>

<ol>
<li>start, stop and pause playback;</li>

<li>warp immediately to the beginning or end of the video;</li>

<li>move to different, arbitrary positions in the video;</li>

<li>increase the playback rate to advance the video more
quickly;</li>

<li>move directly to meaningful locations within the video, such as
beginning of chapters, sections;</li>

<li>search for words in captions and move from section to section
containing that word; and</li>

<li>activate <a href="#_links">links</a> for access to the
associated information</li>
</ol>

<h3><a name="_hyperlinks"></a>2.3 Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>When a learner activates a hyperlink, the playback of the
educational material will pause, and the learner will be presented
with a list of the available information associated with that link
(as described above), and will be able to select from that
list.</p>

<p>A list of all of the links in a presentation will be available
to the learner at all times, in a separate area of the display. The
learner will be able to navigate directly to the location in the
material where a link appears using this list.</p>

<p>For learnerw with visual impairments, an audio indication will
be played when links are presented on screen. Learners will be able
to pause the playback, and hear a list of the links available in
the current phrase of the caption, presented using text-to-speech
(TTS). Activation of the link will cause the associated information
to be read using TTS.</p>

<h3><a name="_learnercaptions"></a>2.4 Learner-Created
Captions</h3>

Learner has access to limited authoring tool and can make custom
caption text tracks to share with other learners. The tool will not
allow for more elaborate kinds of caption creation such as variable
positioning over the video. The caption track is saved as a file
which can be added to the Learning Objects Repository. 

<h3><a name="_notes"></a>2.5 Learner Notes</h3>

Learners will be able to 'take notes' while viewing a video. These
notes will be kept locally (i.e. not uploaded to the Learning
Objects Repository), and will be available on future playbacks of
the same material. Notes differ from <a href=
"#_learnercaptions">Learner-Created Captions</a> in that they are
intended for personal use, not for presentation to other learners,
and are not overlaid on top of the video as captions are. 

<p>Learners will create notes by pausing the video at the desired
time, entering the desired note (for example, by typing), and
saving the note. Learners may enter text into notes, and may mark
text with a hyperlink to other material. Learners may not embed
images or other non-text elements directly into notes.</p>

<p>The note will be time stamped at the specified location for
synchronization in later playbacks.</p>

<p>The learner will be able to specify whether or not notes are
displayed in the Player window. If so, the notes will be presented
in a text list, and learners will be able to navigate to the video
portion associated with any given note by selecting the note from
the list. During playback of a video that has notes, an indication
(visual and/or auditory) will be made when/where notes have been
added. Learners will be able to select whether they would like
visual cues, auditory cues, or both.</p>

<p>Learners will also be able to use the player to view their own
notes without viewing the associated learning materials.</p>

<h3>2.6 Alternative Outputs</h3>

The Player will support devices such as refreshable braille, text
to speech, haptic devices, as well as output in various accessible
medium. It will be compatible with current adaptive technology
text/screen readers (Jaws), Screen enlargers, etc. or will
implement an equivalent functionality. 

<h3><a name="_usercontrol"></a>2.7 Learner Preferences</h3>

To the extent permitted by the author (see <a href=
"#_authprefs">explanation</a>), the learner will have the ability
to select what information presented, and how it is presented.
Specifically: 

<ol>
<li>Learners will be able to specify which alternative formats
(captions and/or audio descriptions) they wish to be presented.
They may select to display more than one text caption
simultaneously. For example, a student learning English as a second
language may wish to display both the English captions and the
captions in their own language. The learner may select alternative
audio captions with reduced background sound for greater
understanding.</li>

<li>Learners will be able to define the appearance of the text
captions. For example, a learner with low vision may prefer a very
large font size, or a particular colour combination.</li>

<li>Learners may control the placement of text captions, as <a
href="#_captionposition">described above</a>.</li>

<li>Learners will be able to adjust the positioning of the video
images (main video and sign language interpretation)</li>
</ol>

<p>Learners will be able to specify their preferences for
configurable features using a Learner Preferences System. These
preferences will be used whenever the learner uses the Player to
view content.</p>

<p>The learner will be able to modify a subset of the attributes
'on the fly', using either on-screen widgets or keystrokes. The
attributes which will be modifiable this way include:</p>

<ol>
<li>Turning captions on or off</li>

<li>Choose condensed versus full captions</li>

<li>Positioning video images and text captions</li>

<li>Setting the audio volume</li>
</ol>

<p>
These changes will apply only to the current session.</p>

<h2>3 Authoring Tool</h2>

The authoring tool will allow authors to classify captions
according to their functions (e.g. language, reading level). The
author will be able to define new custom caption types if so
desired. 

<p>Authors will be able to individually configure the attributes of
text-based captions, including font face, size, colour and
background colour, and container type.</p>

<p>For each visual track (including text-based captions and
graphics) authors will be able to specify the position, on screen,
of the caption. The authoring tool may add a blank area around the
original video that could be used for placement of caption items
which are desired to be NOT overlaid on top of the video. Even if
the author specifies a default position which is overlaid, this
border will remain, so that the user may override the positioning
and place the caption outside the video.</p>

<p><a name="_authprefs"></a>Because authors may wish to use the
position or formatting of captions to convey information, the
ability of the learner to specify their own preferences for these
attributes creates the risk that such information may be lost. For
this reason, the author will be able to specify whether or not the
specified formatting of captions may be overridden by the user.
Three levels will be used:</p>

<ol>
<li>Cannot be overridden at all</li>

<li>May be overridden, but user will be warned that this action may
result in loss of information</li>

<li>May be overridden without warning</li>
</ol>
