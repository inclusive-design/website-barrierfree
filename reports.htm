        <P align="left"> This Java application allows educators and content developers 
          to combine individual learning objects into a multi-layer, interactive 
          presentation. The Authoring Tool can be used to:</P>
      </div>
      <div align="left"> 
        <UL>
          <LI>supplement a video presentation with alternative modalities, including 
            <UL>
              <LI>multiple text caption tracks (e.g. different languages, different 
                reading levels)</LI>
              <LI>multiple audio descriptions (e.g. different languages, etc.)</LI>
              <LI>alternate videos (e.g. ASL translation)</LI>
            </UL>
          </LI>
          <LI> add instructor annotations</LI>
          <LI>add hyperlinks to supplementary information, such as definitions 
            and web-based material</LI>
          <LI>add graphic overlays, such as diagrams, or highlight indicators</LI>
        </UL>
      </div>
      <P align="left">The Authoring Tool is integrated with the Repository, allowing 
        the user to search the Repository for learning objects which could be 
        added to the presentation. The Authoring Tool also creates metadata for 
        the presentation, allowing it to be uploaded to the Repository for other 
        to use and customize.</P>
      <P align="left">The following screen shot shows one view of the current 
        iteration of the authoring tool:</P>

				ALT="Screen shot showing one view of the authoring tool" BORDER="1"></P>
      <H3 align="left"><A NAME="player"></A>Player</H3>
      <P align="left"> This Java application allows learners to access education 
        material authored using the Authoring Tool, and configure it according 
        to their own learning preferences, as specified in the Learner Preferences.</P>
      <P align="left"> The Player will load the learner's selected content from 
        the Repository and configure it according the the learner's presentation 
        preferences. The Player also provides the learner with access to the navigational 
        structure of the presentation, allowing the learner to review the material 
        in a non-linear fashion by navigating directly to any section of the presentation.</P>
      <P align="left"> The Player allows the learner to modify their content and 
        presentation preferences while reviewing the presentation, so that for 
        example, the learner may decide to turn the instructor annotations on 
        or off while viewing.</P>
      <P align="left"> The Player presents the hyperlinks in the presentation 
        to the learner, allowing them to follow the links to view the supplementary 
        information as they desire.</P>
      <P align="left">The following screen shot shows one view of the current 
        iteration of the player:</P>

      <H3 align="left"><A NAME="user"></A>Learner Preferences</H3>
      <P align="left"> The learner's personal preferences, stored using XML and 
        CSS, are used to allow the learner to specify their own choices for selection 
        and presentation of the material in the educational presentation.</P>
      <P align="left"> The learner can specify whether or not they wish to view 
        a text caption, or hear an audio description, and express their preference 
        for which version of the supplementary material they prefer, based on 
        language preferences, and other factors such as reading level. They can 
        indicate whether or not they wish to view any instructor annotation, or 
        supplementary images.</P>
      <P align="left"> In addition to specifying preferences for selection of 
        content, the learner can specify how they wish to have that content presented 
        to them. For example, the appearance of text content can be customized, 
        given different colour schemes, font sizes, and placement on-screen.</P>
      <P align="left">The following screen shot shows one view of the current 
        iteration of the learner preferences interface:</P>

      <H3 align="left"><A NAME="data"></A>Learning Object Repository</H3>
      <P align="left">The functionality of the repository is being expanded, to 
        reflect feedback from user evaluations.</P>
      <P align="left">The Learning Object Repository is designed to provide services 
        to three classes of user:</P>
      <div align="left"> 
        <OL>
          <LI>End users accessing the repository from a web-based search page 
            with an "off-the-shelf" browser such as Internet Explorer or Netscape.</LI>
          <LI>Authors of the complex learning objects who will be using the Authoring 
            Tool.</LI>
          <LI> End users who access the repository via Player.</LI>
        </OL>
      </div>
      <P align="left">The following screen shot shows one view of the repository 
        search user interface:</P>
      <P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="images/authtool-search-repos.png"
				WIDTH="500" HEIGHT="375" ALT="Screen shot showing repository search interface"
				BORDER="1"></P>
      <P align="left">The repository is organized around a three tier architecture.</P>
      <P align="left"> The first tier is the database itself. The current implementation 
        uses Oracle 8i, although the three-tier architecture will make it possible 
        to replace the present database component with an object-oriented database 
        or some of the XML databases currently being developed. </P>
      <P align="left">The database supports</P>
      <div align="left"> 
        <UL>
          <LI> the storage of XML data in database fields. </LI>
          <LI> the ability to search on textual data in much the same way as users 
            have become accustomed to when using a web-based search engine.</LI>
          <LI>storing large objects such as video and audio files.</LI>
          <LI>maintaining relationships among database objects.</LI>
        </UL>
      </div>
      <P align="left"> The second tier of the learning repository is a "server". 
        The server communicates with the database component using JDBC (Java Database 
        Connectivity) and communicates with other software components (the authoring 
        tool and the player) via Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation). To programmers, 
        the database appears as an object. The server also manages the communication 
        with the web-based end users. </P>
      <P align="left">The third tier of the repository is the client software 
        which runs on the computers used by the end users. </P>
      <P align="left">The database itself contains two major types of components:</P>
      <P align="left"> "Primitive" objects with associated metadata. Examples 
        of these primitive objects are videos, caption tracks, text, audio, and 
        graphics. The metadata which describes them is represented as IMS compatible 
        XML and includes:</P>
      <div align="left"> 
        <UL>
          <LI>general information such as title, language, description, keywords, 
            etc.</LI>
          <LI> technical information about the resource such as mime type, operating 
            system requirements, etc.</LI>
          <LI>educational information such as grade level, interactivity level, 
            typical learning time, etc.</LI>
        </UL>
      </div>
      <P align="left"> The second of the two major database components is what 
        we call an assembly object. Assembly objects represent collections of 
        the primitive objects described above and may include other assembly objects. 
      </P>
      <P align="left">Like the primitive objects, assembly objects are described 
        by XML metadata. This metadata includes:</P>
      <div align="left"> 
        <UL>
          <LI> information about the object as a whole. This information is similar 
            in form and content to metadata describing the primitive objects.</LI>
          <LI>author preferences.</LI>
          <LI>for each learning object 
            <UL>
              <LI>a reference pointer to it.</LI>
              <LI>start time and duration information.</LI>
              <LI>positioning and layering information.</LI>
            </UL>
          </LI>
        </UL>
      </div>
      <P align="left"> The database builds indices on the XML metadata fields 
        and attributes which permit rapid searches by end users on any IMS or 
        CANCORE metadata field. </P>
      <P align="left">Free text indices are also built on caption track data permitting 
        more precise searches.</P>
      <H3 align="left"><A NAME="vid"></A>Accessible and Customizable Educational 
        Videos</H3>
      <P align="left">The tool and player developed by this project have an important 
        end goal in mind- the production of accessible and customizable interactive 
        educational videos. Teacher/authors can use the authoring tool to create 
        educational videos customized with content related to their own particular 
        classroom, and designed to meet their partucular student's learning needs. 
        Students, as learners, can set their own user preferences and engage in 
        supplementary materials that assist them in their learning. In order to 
        illustrate the usefulness of these ideals, the partners involved in this 
        project have collaborated and developed a sample half-hour video. Episode 
        one of the Canadian Learning Television series "Physics- A World in Motion" 
        has been enhanced with caption tracks, audio descriptions and a broad 
        range of supplementary learning materials, including web-based simulations, 
        diagrams, tables, charts and haptics exercises. This video represents 
        the power of being able to transform learning materials to meet the individual 
        needs of both the instructor and the learners.<BR>

        "Physics- A World in Motion" Video Content</A></P>
      <H3 align="left"><A NAME="sign"></A>Sign Translation Requirements </H3>
      <P align="left">In preparing the evaluation material for American Sign Language 
        (ASL) translation it was determined by the partners that this deliverable 
        should be expanded. One of the considerations not included in the original 
        plan was to determine how Broadband systems can help to overcome some 
        of the problems of traditional broadcast ASL translation. Because of the 
        ability to view materials in a non-linear fashion, to display overlay 
        graphics and to show more than one video window, a number of traditional 
        challenges to effective ASL translation may be overcome in a broadband 
        environment.<I> </I></P>
