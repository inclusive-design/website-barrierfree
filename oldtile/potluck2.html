        <h2>REPORT ON SECOND COMMUNITY POTLUCK</h2>
        <p>Wendy Porch &amp; Vera Roberts<br />
          June 19, 2003</p>
        </div>
      <p>Theme: &#8220;Customizing Content&#8221;</p>
	  
	   <p><a href="potluck2/outcomes/Calgary_Potluck.ppt">Presentation by Jutta Treviranus</a> (PPT Format)  </p>
        
      <p>On June 19, 2003, participants gathered at the University of Calgary 
        Learning Commons for the second of four TILE Community Potlucks coordinated 
        by the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC). The TILE project would 
        like to express our appreciation to the Alberta Online Consortium for 
        their role in organizing this event. Community potlucks are slated to 
        occur once every quarter and are intended to provide partners and those 
        interested in e-learning from the larger community the opportunity to 
        collaborate and exchange information related to learning object repositories, 
        transformable content and their impact on e-learning. </p>
      <p>The Calgary potluck included representatives from the ATRC, Canadian 
        Learning Television, University of Calgary, Athabasca, Argyll Project 
        as well as front line teachers and other educators who specialize in e-learning. 
        Jutta Treviranus, director for the ATRC, gave a <a href="potluck2/outcomes/Calgary_Potluck.ppt">presentation</a> 
        that provided participants with an overview of the day's activities as 
        well as a framework for understanding the theme of the potluck, &#8220;Customizing 
        Content.&#8221; Participants were asked to consider &#8220;What kind of 
        learning activity structures can be reused?&#8221;, &#8220;How generic 
        can the learning activities be?&#8221;, &#8220;How much can we modularize?&#8221; 
        and &#8220;What supports do educators need?&#8221;</p>
      <p>With these questions in mind, participants broke out into groups lead 
        by the ATRC participants. Each group worked together on an <a href="#activities">activity</a> 
        that explored the concept of customizing content. Each group was asked 
        to create nine learning activities through a process that changed content 
        but not the activity or that changed the activity but not the content. 
        In this way, the groups were able to consider and try re-purposing of 
        content and learning structures.</p>
      <p>In the afternoon, each group presented their learning <a href="#activities">activities</a> 
        to the other participants and discussion followed each work. Some of the 
        themes that arose were as follows:</p>
      <p>Support: Teachers require support for any technology successfully implemented. 
        How can this support be provided? Various types of suggestions were made 
        from teaching information technology in pre-service to requiring that 
        teachers undertake continuing education in learning object repositories 
        and related technology. These suggestion raised further questions around 
        incentives; it was thought that time strapped teachers would require incentive 
        to produce learning objects and upload them to repositories.</p>
      <p>Rights: Who owns learning objects that are made on teacher&#8217;s off 
        hours? Alberta has recently said that even if it was created in off hours 
        that it is possession of board not teacher. What is the impact of this 
        decision?</p>
      <p>Object Information: Reading levels need to be addressed and teachers 
        need this information to make choices from learning object repositories. 
        Learning outcomes need be stated in the repository browser tool.</p>
      <p>Granularity: Do we separate images from text in the LOR to enable accommodation 
        of different reading levels and/or language skills?</p>
      <p>Relevance: Curriculum correlations for materials in the LOR are important; 
        who would update these are requirements change. Teachers said relevancy 
        would be integral to the successful use of LOR. Maintenance is important 
        so that content in the LOR retains usefulness and relevancy.</p>
      <p>During the closing discussion, the participants agreed that the day&#8217;s 
        exercise offered proof that content could effectively be re-used, however, 
        one teacher posed a question about the learning templates: if content 
        is stripped from learning templates don&#8217;t they all just become so 
        generic that they all seem the same? Is there a danger of this happening?</p>
      <p>Overall, the participants gave great support for theory of reusability 
        of learning objects through repository although questions remain regarding 
        support, training, incentives to participate, rights questions, training. 
      </p>
      <p>The TILE Community Potluck raised several significant points for further 
        exploration and development and provided opportunity to test out some 
        of the ideas around customizing content. Canadian Learning Television 
        was on hand filming this TILE community potluck event for use in a television 
        spot about the project to be aired at a later date. We will provide airing 
        details for this material when they are made available. </p>
