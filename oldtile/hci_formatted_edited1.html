  <p align="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>A-Prompt is a tool that enables web developers 
    to check for and repair barriers to access in their developed site pages. 
    A-Prompt was developed with three principles in mind: automation, integration 
    and education. The result is a web content accessibility checking and repair 
    tool. Survey results indicate that the founding principles of A-Prompt are 
    sound and that further development of the tool is merited. Issues related 
    to development, integration and standardization of A-Prompt are discussed 
    and future directions for the tool’s development are considered.</FONT></p>

  <li><B><FONT SIZE=3>Introduction</FONT></B></li>
  <FONT SIZE=2> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A-Prompt had its origin, in 1995, in a collaborative project 
    between the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC) and SoftQuad Inc. The 
    aim was to build prompting and guidance regarding accessibility directly into 
    the most popular HTML authoring tool at the time, namely: HoTMetaL. Since 
    then, thanks to funding from National Institute on Disability and Rehabilitation 
    Research (NIDRR), A-Prompt has been recreated as a free standing evaluation 
    and repair application and as a DLL that can be integrated into HTML authoring 
    tools to test for both W3C Web Content Accessibility Guidelines compliance 
    and US Rehab 508 compliance.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Throughout its evolution A-Prompt has always been designed 
    with three precepts in mind: 
  <ul type="disc">
    <li>automate as many evaluations and repairs as possible so that the author’s 
      energies can be devoted to evaluations and repairs requiring human judgment,</li>
    <LI>wherever and whenever possible integrate support for access into the initial 
      authoring process, and</LI>
    <LI>educate authors on accessible design, but also design the tool so that 
      even authors without the knowledge or the will necessary to produce accessible 
      documents will be supported in creating accessible web sites.</LI></P>
    
  </ul>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A-Prompt exemplifies the implementation of a carefully developed 
    set of heuristics and diagnostics to identify and repair barriers to access. 
    The A-Prompt techniques form the basis for and closely follow the Techniques 
    for Accessibility and Evaluation and Repair Tools (AERT) developed by the 
    Evaluation and Repair Tools Working Group of the W3C Web Accessibility Initiative. 
    While the AERT techniques are now being integrated with the documentation 
    of the Authoring Tools Working Group and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 
    Working Group, it remains significant as an outline of strategies that evaluation 
    and repair tools may use to uncover accessibility problems and repair them.</P>
  <DIR> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These principles form the basis of objectives for the A-Prompt 
    project: to enable seamless checking for accessibility issues in web development 
    environments, to repair and log repair decisions so that burden on the author 
    is minimized, to help develop standard practices for issue detection and repair 
    and to move towards integration of A-Prompt functionality into commercial 
    development environments.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Before starting on the development for version 2 of A-Prompt, 
    the ATRC undertook a study to determine user needs. A form containing 28 questions 
    was made available at the A-Prompt web site that allowed users to enter general 
    and specific data regarding their A-Prompt use. An email inviting users to 
    complete the form was distributed to several listserves and our mailing list 
    of A-Prompt users. </P>

  <p align="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2><FONT SIZE=2>Over 70 users completed the survey 
    to date. Fifty-two participants describe their development experience as expert 
    or intermediate and half (35) of the respondents are website managers or content 
    creators.</FONT></FONT></p>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our survey we asked users about their A-Prompt use and 
    discovered that use declined over time (see figure 1). </P>

  </B></FONT> <FONT SIZE=2> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A central goal of A-Prompt is to educate users about accessibility 
    issues and to train them in creating more accessible web pages. The product 
    contains extensive help files that not only identify the accessibility problems 
    but describe how and why they must be corrected. Each dialog that repairs 
    an accessibility problem includes text that describes the problem and offers 
    suggestions for making the repair. Our intention was that eventually the user 
    would modify their authoring practices to create more accessible content. 
    The reason that most users (31%) gave as the reason for their decreased use 
    was that they could now find and repair accessibility problems themselves 
    indicating that our educational approach was working.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In our user survey, we asked users why they were checking 
    for accessibility and found that the largest response was to make the site 
    more useful (figure 2). While government regulations and company policy were 
    major factors, general usability and a personal concern for people with disabilities 
    encouraged more people to consider accessibility checking. </P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There exist several legislations throughout the world that 
    force web authors to make their sites more accessible. In Canada there is 
    the Common Look And Feel guidelines that apply to all federally governed sites. 
    The United States has section 508 of The Rehabilitation act, Germany has enacted 
    BITV and there are others. The result of these laws has been to increase the 
    awareness of web accessibility and to encourage web authors to include accessibility 
    as part of their authoring process. While these laws have been necessary, 
    the A-Prompt philosophy has been to encourage accessibility as part of general 
    usability. Documentation in the product has stressed that as a site becomes 
    more accessible to people with disabilities, the site is also more accessible 
    to all users. Sites that comply with accessibility standards offer advantages 
    over non-compliant sites. Users can find information quicker, the site displays 
    well on a wider range of user agents and a wider population can access the 
    site. We have found that business leaders, while cognizant of government regulations, 
    are more likely to listen to arguments that will encourage more and happier 
    customers. The response to this survey question has further strengthened our 
    belief in the philosophy that accessibility is usability and that increased 
    usability is a helpful selling point for businesses unwilling to change their 
    web sites for accessibility reasons alone.</P>

  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The key A-Prompt objective is to promote creation of accessible 
    web content. Several factors are associated with meeting this goal successfully: 
    developer needs and acceptance, site owner business objectives, standards 
    of practice and transparency of the tool. Each of these factors has been addressed 
    by the development team in a variety of ways. The development of A-Prompt 
    and actions taken by the ATRC to enable successful implementation and acceptance 
    of A-Prompt are outlined in the following sections.</P>

  <p><B><FONT SIZE=2> Public Interface for A-Prompt and Integration with Other 
    Tools</FONT></B></p>
</blockquote>
<OL>
  <FONT SIZE=2> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A-Prompt contains a public Application Programming Interface 
    (API) that allows other programs to integrate and use the A-Prompt functionality. 
    The API takes the form of a simple DLL with exported function calls that may 
    be accessed by programs written in most common languages such as C, C++ or 
    Visual Basic. It was our intention that HTML authoring programs would make 
    use of this API and integrate the A-Prompt functionality much like a traditional 
    spell checker utility. We envisioned that as the user authored their HTML 
    document, A-Prompt would be called on a periodic basis to validate and repair 
    its accessibility. We’ve had a great deal of interest in the API but have 
    been unable to announce that a commercial HTML editor program has integrated 
    A-Prompt. </P>
  </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B> Future development of the API</LI> </B> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Version 2 of A-Prompt will contain an updated version of 
    the API that exposes more components of the program’s functionality. It will 
    be possible for host programs to have fine control over each repair that A-Prompt 
    performs. The host program will also be able to control which accessibility 
    checks and heuristics are applied in A-Prompt’s evaluation engine.</P>

</blockquote>
<OL>
  <FONT SIZE=2> 
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A common complaint from users performing accessibility checking 
    is the lack of consistency between validation tools. All of the current accessibility 
    checking software programs use different testing criteria. This lack of consistency 
    is discouraging to users and weakens the acceptance of accessibility guidelines. 
    If we liken accessibility validation to the use of a spell checker then we 
    must promote the use of a single dictionary of testing criteria for all tools.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A-Prompt’s accessibility checking is based upon the Web Accessibility 
    Initiative (WAI) technical document titled Accessibility Evaluation and Repair 
    Techniques (AERT). This document lists, as much as possible, all the checks 
    that must be performed to validate a document for compliance with the WAI’s 
    Web Content Accessibility Guidelines WCAG). Unfortunately, not all the WAI 
    guidelines can be validated by a series of checks and not all are detailed 
    in the AERT. This gap has lead to the variance in the checking techniques 
    used by different software tools.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ATRC has been working with other accessibility validation 
    tools to create a common set of algorithms for HTML accessibility. If adopted, 
    this common set would also allow for the interoperability of checking tools. 
    For example, a tool that just performs accessibility evaluations could pass 
    invalid HTML code to a tool, like A-Prompt, that can repair the HTML code.</P>
  <P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Each accessibility check that is performed by A-Prompt will 
    be fully exposed and documented so that other checking programs can determine 
    our compliance to accessibility standards. These checks will be made available 
    to the user so they can modify or create their own standards. For example, 
    some companies have currently adopted a low conformance rating but are moving 
    towards a higher standard and will to include some, but not all, of the higher 
    standard’s accessibility checks. A-Prompt’s checklist is stored in a separate 
    file using the EARL standard format. The checklist file may be easily shared 
    amongst users so they have a common set of accessibility checks. The checklist 
    file may also be used in the creation of accessibility validation reports 
    that will then be more accurate and detailed.</P>

<blockquote> 
  <p><B><font size="2"> Expanded Registry &amp; EARL</font></B></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>As part of the accessibility validation process, 
    the user must make decisions about many of the document components. For example, 
    if an image appears in an HTML document, the user must decide if the image 
    is complex enough that it requires a textual description beyond what is contained 
    in the short ‘alternate’ text. Even a relatively simple document may require 
    dozens of user decisions in order to make a complete evaluation. These user 
    decisions must be recorded and stored so the user is not asked to repeat their 
    decisions each time the document is evaluated.</FONT></p>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>A standard method of recording this accessibility 
    evaluation information has been developed and is used by A-Prompt. Called 
    EARL, for Evaluation And Report Language, it is a Resource Description Language 
    (RDF) dialect that allows accessibility checking tools to state exact information 
    about their evaluations. Information stored in this standard format may be 
    re-used by other tools to provide other accessibility reports. A-Prompt’s 
    use of EARL is intended to reduce the number of redundant decisions that are 
    required for a complete accessibility evaluation.</FONT></p>

<blockquote>
  <p align="JUSTIFY"><FONT SIZE=2>Ideally, all Web authoring interfaces, would 
    in themselves provide utilities to prompt the creation of accessible content, 
    this would insure that accessible authoring does not require retrofitting 
    and becomes a naturally integrated, habitual step in creating resources for 
    the web. Until this ideal is the norm rather than the exception, A-Prompt 
    and systems like it provide the tools and model developers need to produce 
    accessible web sites. Throughout it’s relatively long history, A-Prompt has 
    been used to pilot and model the support of accessible authoring practices 
    and has thereby played an important role in the market and in the efforts 
    of the Web Accessibility Initiative. Ongoing development of A-Prompt is planned 
    so that the tool will continue to enable developers using new techniques such 
    as XML and dynamic web content or courseware environments to continue to create 
    accessible content. </FONT></p>
