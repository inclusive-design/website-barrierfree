      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Most 

        learners and educators would agree that the ideal educational environment 

        has at its core one-on-one teaching that is closely customized to the 

        needs of the individual learner. In all current educational sectors, one-on-one 

        teaching is very rare. Learners must make-do with instruction geared toward 

        the average student or the perceived norm. This leads to a large segment 

        of marginalized students who do not fit the norm. They may differ in their 

        background knowledge, level of understanding of the topic, learning outcome 

        goals, learning style, learning skills and accessibility needs. With dynamic 

        web technologies and broadband we have the opportunity to deliver the 

        approximation of one-on-one teaching. The on-line educational environment 

        could be responsive to a number of learner needs and preferences. These 

        preferences could be general learning preferences or preferences related 

        to a particular learning session. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">These 

        candidate general preferences include:</font></p>

      <ul>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Styling 

          preferences: This includes the information layout, the font size, and 

          the colours used on the page. For someone with low vision this may make 

          the difference between illegible and legible content. </font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Depth 

          of Navigation Tree: Some learners prefer to have all possible links 

          shown on one page while others prefer to have top level links with lower 

          level links appearing on subsequent linked-to pages.</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Classification 

          or Sorting Preferences: Mail archives frequently offer the choice of 

          sorting by sender, date, subject, priority level among others. Other 

          sorting criteria could include level of difficulty, match with expressed 

          learning outcome goals and teaching style.</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Access 

          Requirements: Learners with disabilities frequently require alternative 

          access strategies such as screen reading for people who blind, or on-screen 

          keyboards for people who cannot use a mouse or keyboard. The preferences 

          can address both the type of alternative access technology and the preference 

          settings for the access technology (e.g., voice rate and pitch, key 

          size and spacing)</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Equivalent 

          Content Requirements: Learners with sensory impairments require streaming 

          auditory or visual information to be provided in another modality but 

          synchronized to the primary content. The system can provide the requested 

          type of equivalent content (captioning, ASL, video description) delivered 

          according to the user’s preference (styling, layout, reading level, 

          etc.).</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Testing 

          Equivalents: Learners with disabilities or language constraints are 

          unable to answer certain kinds of test questions. These individuals 

          require test questions in an accessible modality that are equivalent 

          in the skills or knowledge being tested. </font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Language: 

          The learner may have an alternative language requirement, or may wish 

          the content to be displayed in two languages to support better comprehension. 

          </font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Content 

          Density: Some learners prefer to master on overview of the content and 

          then learn the specifics of each subtopic, while others prefer to move 

          sequentially through all the details of the topic. </font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Content 

          Views (Image intensive, text intensive): Some learners are best supported 

          through visual illustrations of the content, while graphics and images 

          may be distracting or inaccessible to other learners.</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Learner 

          Scaffolding types: Learners require individualized learner supports. 

          Some learners benefit from readily available definitions of terms, others 

          benefit from exercises or illustrations of concepts, while still others 

          require peer interaction to fully integrate a concept. </font></li>

      </ul>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Candidate 

        preferences that relate to a specific learning session include: </font></p>

      <ol>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Learner 

          Outcome Goals: Learners approach learning content with different outcome 

          goals. A system that organizes content in support of the outcome goal 

          and assists the user in tracking their progression toward the goal may 

          assist in achieving the learning outcome. </font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Topic 

          Exclusions: In some instances, less is more. A filter to exclude content 

          that is not of interest or is already learned may help the learner to 

          focus on the target content.</font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Placeholders, 

          Annotation and Knowledge Review: Progression through specific learning 

          content would be supported by allowing the learner to create placeholders, 

          personal annotations and by creating a synopsis or review of the previous 

          session. </font></li>

        <li><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Facilitation 

          of Communities of Interest. Learners vary regarding their preference 

          for the frequency and timing of peer interaction in support of learning. 

          Methods of facilitating group interaction while respecting personal 

          preferences will be investigated.</font></li>

      </ol>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">The 

        project will demonstrate the potential benefits of personalized courseware 

        for the learner and the impact this would have on the educator or content 

        producer. A core assumption of learner-centric courseware delivery, whether 

        it is simply providing device independent information or full learning-style 

        accommodation, is that the content delivery medium can be independent 

        of the content while still achieving a consistent learning outcome. This 

        requires a dramatic shift in instructional design that most educators 

        are not cognizant of when designing learning material for the web. It 

        requires a deconstruction of teaching and a new set of authoring tools 

        and supports. Most web-authoring tool features concentrate on the specific 

        visual presentation of the material. They do not assist the author in 

        extracting the content and structure and determining whether it transforms 

        gracefully while still retaining the intended learning message. Most educators 

        devote a great deal of attention to designing the presentation of the 

        learning content at the expense of refining the content and its structure. 

        Through this project we hope to demonstrate the practical boundaries of 

        transformable content and the tools needed to support the mastery of learner 

        customizable teaching. The efficacy of candidate preference settings will 

        be tested through iterative pilot trials. A refined list of preferences 

        will be developed and implemented.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Donald 

        Norman has highlighted the risk inherent in using modular, re-usable learning 

        objects: by excessive granularity and modularity we threaten the coherency 

        of the learning experience. Phase 1 of the Barrierfree project demonstrated 

        that coherency can be maintained even when personalizing and re-purposing 

        learning objects. This is achieved by providing a coherent story line 

        or learning structure. Through TILE we will extend this transformability 

        to media types other than video. A more generic but equivalent learning 

        structure will be employed. The backbone of the learning structure will 

        be the learning plan, this learning plan will be populated with a number 

        of modular learning objectives, each of which will be populated with any 

        number of content objects. The content objects can include exercises, 

        simulations, publications, self tests, etc. Each content object will be 

        flexible in terms of how it is displayed and how it is controlled. If 

        the content object cannot be transformed directly an equivalent will be 

        available in other modalities. At its simplest, the learning content will 

        be organized in the following hierarchy: 1) a learning plan assembly object 

        2) a number of modular learning objective assembly objects, 3) and many 

        associated content objects.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">TILE 

        will also address the current issues raised at the forefront of Learning 

        Object theory. Leaders in the field have come to realize that instructional 

        design needs to play a larger role in LOR architectures <a href="http://wiley.ed.usu.edu/docs/astd.pdf">http://wiley.ed.usu.edu/docs/astd.pdf</a>. 

        TILE partners will design a simple architecture for collaborative and 

        cumulative authoring that is consistent with the latest in learning design 

        theory. The draft IMS Learning Design Information Model Version 1.0 Base 

        Specification will be used to tag the learning structure and individual 

        objects. The project will provide input to the working group on the technical 

        and practical implementation of the specification. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">To 

        understand the functionality to be developed by TILE, imagine the following 

        example within an adult learning situation: </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399"><b><a name="week"></a>&quot;A 

        Week in the Life of a Transformable Learning Object&quot;</b></font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Ryan, 

        a tutor with Frontier College, works with a learner Jim, who would like 

        to learn to use on-line banking, since the trek to the bank is difficult 

        during the winter. Jim needs assistance in learning to use the interface, 

        reading and comprehending the information on the screens, paying the bills 

        that he receives regularly and keeping track of his balances. Ryan uses 

        the on-line learning design structure to specify the overall learning 

        plan and the individual objectives. These he then populates with the actual 

        screens that Jim will encounter at each step, his own clarifications of 

        components of the screen, step by step instructions on how to accomplish 

        each task, ways to recognize and correct errors, and instructions on how 

        to verify that he has been successful. This completed assembly object 

        or lesson is checked into the repository. An accessibility checking tool 

        checks to see that any non-text elements are accessible and guides Ryan 

        in correcting any accessibility errors. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">When 

        Jim views the lesson the service delivers the assembly object according 

        to Jim’s previously expressed learner preferences. His preferences specify 

        where, when and how clarifications, instructions, help, and self evaluations 

        will be displayed and how feedback will be given. Because Jim has a learning 

        disability all text will be read to him when he points to it using his 

        head pointer. Because he has difficulty pointing accurately all active 

        areas of the screen such as buttons or input fields will be enlarged. 

        </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Mary 

        is working with a learner, Ferdinand, who uses the same bank but has a 

        different set of bills to pay. She checks out the lesson and replaces 

        the learning content pertaining to the unwanted bills with information 

        about bills relevant to Ferdinand. Because Ferdinand is learning English 

        and is more conversant in Spanish, Mary adds a Spanish translation of 

        the clarifications and instructions, help and feedback. Mary also remembers 

        a very simple to use accessible calculator that she has previously seen 

        in a linked repository. She searches for it and adds a link to it. She 

        then checks this new version of the lesson or assembly object into the 

        repository. When Ferdinand accesses the lesson he reads and listens to 

        both the English and Spanish text. </font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Judith 

        is trainer with the bank referenced in the lesson. She has just created 

        an educational video about on-line banking. She uses the Barrierfree tool 

        to structure the synchronized verbatim captions of the video and then 

        links the indexed segments of the video to the appropriate points in the 

        learning plan. When Jim next views the lesson he can choose to reinforce 

        what he is learning with the instructional video.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">Alfred 

        is a tutor working with a class who need to access the on-line banking 

        service of another bank. He views the lesson and decides that he likes 

        the structure of the learning plan and many of the generic explanations, 

        but he must replace the screen shots and detailed instructions. After 

        doing this he checks the new version of the lesson or assembly object 

        into the repository.</font></p>

      <p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2" color="#003399">The 

        repository has a record of each instance of the assembly object as well 

        as the cumulative master assembly object. Thus the next educator/author 

        can view and use resources from any of the derivative assembly objects.</font></p>
