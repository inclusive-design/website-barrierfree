  TILE Potluck Group Activity</h1>
<strong>November 14, 2003 </strong>
<h2> <strong>Group Activity - meeting the needs of learners who have learning 
  challenges</strong></h2>
<hr>
<p>The purpose of this activity is to explore the following questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>What types of learning breakdown can be addressed with individualized instruction?</li>
  <li> What parameters do we customize to the individual to promote learning?</li>
  <li> What parameters can be individualized in an online environment?</li>
  <li> What supports do educators need to deliver individualized or learner-centric 
    instruction?</li>
</ul>
<p>The group activity will act as a catalyst for plenary discussion of how TILE 
  tools can support these transformations of content, activities and delivery.</p>
<hr>
<h2> Activity 1: </h2>
<p>Identify an instance in your life when you had difficulty learning something.<br>
  Postulate the reasons why you had difficulty learning the concept/activity/skill.<br>
  List the strategies you used to finally learn the concept/activity/skill.<br>
  Discuss these with your group and synthesize the list of barriers and the strategies 
  for overcoming the barriers.</p>
<hr>
<h2>Activity 2: </h2>
<p> Your group is asked to develop learning paths for two different individuals 
  who face learning challenges. You can plan these online activities for the example 
  learners based on any actual or imagined individuals of your choosing. The following 
  resources are provided:</p>
<ul>
  <li>A learning objective</li>
  <li> Several curriculum content samples and learner scaffolds</li>
  <li> Powerpoint template for group presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>1. Create descriptions for two &quot;learners&quot; with learning challenges. 
  Here is an example description:</p>
<p><em>Example: Joe is a young adult who has a learning disability. Joe has difficulty 
  with lengthy print passages, though his comprehension improves when he is able 
  to listen to information being presented. He also has difficulty navigating 
  complex text-based Web resources and utilities.</em></p>
<p>2. Describe how these two learners learn best. Here is an example description: 
</p>
<p><em>Example:<br>
  Joe prefers:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em> large size, sans-serif fonts for the text content</em></li>
  <li><em> use of text-to-speech software to provide redundant modality (audio 
    as well as visual)</em></li>
  <li><em> navigation using graphical icons</em></li>
  <li><em> ability to skim an overview of the content before selecting relevant 
    sections.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>3. Both of these learners are taking a course on &quot;Science as a Way of 
  Knowing: Geography and the Fur Trade.&quot; The course examines the impact of 
  the Fur Trade on Native people in Canada, and the ways in which this period 
  of cultural change affected the use and creation of new technologies, as well 
  as the adoption of old technologies across cultures. The focus is on encouraging 
  scientific literacy and understanding of the natural world in a cultural context 
  as it relates to human geography.</p>
<p>One of the expected learning objectives is: </p>
<p><strong><em>By the end of this lesson, learners will be able to locate relevant 
  information about the impact of the fur trade on Canada's Native people, using 
  a variety of online resources.</em></strong></p>
<p>In your Powerpoint presentation, propose a learning design for each of these 
  learners that would allow each learner to achieve the best learning outcome? 
</p>
<p><em>The following is an example learning design:</em></p>
<ul>
  <li><em> access online field trip</em></li>
  <li><em> locate a word or phrase related to the lesson or that the learner does 
    not know</em></li>
  <li><em> look it up online</em></li>
  <li><em> give a definition and a related example.</em></li>
</ul>
<p> Use the Powerpoint presentation that shows how you would personalize the learning 
  environment to meet the learners' specific needs. A number of curriculum resources 
  are provided for this exercise. Describe how you would modify and use these 
  resources to create a learning design that is optimized for your learners. Choose 
  and assemble curriculum content from the resources provided.</p>
<p>Personalization could include the path and pace of learning as well as customizing 
  the display, control and structural presentation, learner scaffold and supplementary 
  material. Show the learner's path through the content, indicating tools used 
  and supports required. Include the supports you would need as an educator to 
  prepare the optimized learning design. Add this to your powerpoint as well.</p>
<hr>
<p>Be prepared to report back to the larger group in the afternoon.</p>
<p>If time allows, begin discussion of how authoring tools and utilities will 
  help you most in providing content in flexible formats.</p>
