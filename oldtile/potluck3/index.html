        <h2>REPORT OF THIRD COMMUNITY POTLUCK</h2>
      </div>
      <p class="MsoNormal">The Inclusive Learning Exchange (TILE) Community Potluck 
        Event, Fredericton, New Brunswick, November 14, 2003</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Robert Luke, ATRC</p>
      <p>Theme: Meeting the Needs of Diverse Learners</p>
      <p>The Third TILE community potluck event was held 14 November in Fredericton, 
        New Brunswick, hosted by the National adult Literacy Database (NALD).  
        The event was held at the Wu Conference Centre at the University of New 
        Brunswick, and was the third of four planned <span
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">TILE Community Potlucks coordinated by the Adaptive 
        Technology Resource Centre (ATRC). These community potlucks occur every 
        quarter, and are designed to give partners updates as to the TILE project 
        progress, as well as to get insight and input as to the TILE development 
        process.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">The TILE potluck 
        event in Fredericton had in attendance people from NALD, Frontier College, 
        the University of Toronto’s Transitional year Program, the National Research 
        Council, various provincial literacy and educational organizations, the 
        ATRC, and others.  The theme of the event was “</span>Meeting the Needs 
        of Diverse Learners.”  Participants were asked to respond to an initial 
        overview by Jutta Treviranus, director of the ATRC.  Jutta provided participants 
        with an overview of the goals of the TILE project, as well as the outline 
        for the day’s activities.  </p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Participants were asked to consider what <span
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">“</span>Meeting the Needs of Diverse Learners” could 
        or would entail with respect to the provision of e-learning content.  
        The idea was to get feedback into the kinds of content transformations 
        would best help meet the needs of diverse learners accessing e-learning 
        content.  Within this conceptual framework, participants were asked to 
        consider the following questions: <span
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">What types of learning breakdown can be addressed 
        with individualized instruction? What parameters do we customize to the 
        individual to promote learning? What parameters can be individualized 
        in an online environment? What supports do educators need to deliver individualized 
        or learner-centric instruction?  These questions were intended to stimulate 
        discussion on leaner and educator supports that could be built, as well 
        as to what content transformations would be most useful – and usable – 
        for learners with “learning challenges.”</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Breakout groups were then formed to get four different 
        perspectives on the issues being discussed.  Each group was asked to list 
        learning barriers and the strategies for overcoming the barriers.  They 
        then created one or two examples of learners and their preferences, and 
        detailed ways in which these preferences and barriers could work within 
        a particular learning objective.  This learning objective was designed 
        to get people thinking about content transformations and multimedia, learning 
        styles, as well as to provide examples of how TILE content to date can 
        be cross-purposed and reused to provide the kinds of learner supports 
        that would be helpful to those who may face a particular obstacle in learning, 
        and what providing these may mean to the educator.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> Each group was then asked to present their overviews 
        to the rest of the participants.  These led to fruitful discussions on 
        the nature of transformations and the potential these may have for learners.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Various themes emerged from the various breakout groups 
        and their discussions of learning challenges, strategies, and educator 
        needs.  There was general agreement that various learning styles and abilities 
        can be met with assistive technologies (screen readers, text-to-speech, 
        etc.) that would benefit learners with low literacy levels.  Educators 
        would find useful resources that would enable them to provide “remedial 
        detours” for their students should these be needed.  These kinds of scaffolding 
        supports could be available based on need and learning context.  Supports 
        for peer interaction would be beneficial, as would alternative ways for 
        students to participate in aspects of learning activities (online presentations 
        and video, versus in person presentations, for example).  The idea of 
        peer interaction and mentoring was raised as a good way to encourage critical 
        reflection and reflective learning among learners who may not have good 
        learning skills to begin with, or are shy or face some other obstacle 
        to full and meaningful participation in learning activities. Ways of enabling 
        anonymous feedback were also seen as having potential for shy students.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"> Participants identified various resources that educators 
        could utilize, acknowledging that when we are dealing with learner content 
        transformations and scaffolds, this puts addition demand on educators 
        and instructors.  Technical support and assistance with aspects of online 
        instruction, adaptive technology, and familiarity with learning styles 
        and theory were identified as being potentially helpful.  Educators will 
        need to know how to meet various learning styles and challenges, why this 
        is important, and what it means to their instruction.  The idea of fostering 
        <span
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">communities of educators fits well with the TILE 
        mandate of encouraging a shared repository of resources that can be easily 
        reused by many educators.  Communities of educators would also help in 
        the provision of assistance for technical and learning matters, as collective 
        knowledge generation about meeting the needs of diverse learners would 
        help the community as a whole learn how best to use transformable content 
        and various scaffolds to the best educational advantage.  </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal">Anastasia Cheetham, <span
lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">TILE Software Designer at the ATRC, then presented 
        to the entire group some of the transformations currently possible in 
        the TILE Repository Service Web Interface (RSWI).  Participants were shown 
        how the TILE preferences system works to enable learners to easily customize 
        their learning interface. Robert Luke, ATRC researcher, ended the day 
        with a brief review of the social context of flexible e-learning and asked 
        participants to consider issues of interaction and evaluation with respect 
        to providing multiple learning paths for learners.</span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal"><span lang="EN-CA" xml:lang="EN-CA">The TILE community 
        potluck in Fredericton was successful in generating very good discussion 
        about the implications of customizing content presentation.  The ATRC 
        team received good feedback on the state of the TILE work to date, as 
        well as key input as to future directions the service could take. The 
        event raised several key questions about content scaffolds, software supports, 
        and future hardware and software needs that would be ideal in any future 
        e-learning environment.  </span></p>
