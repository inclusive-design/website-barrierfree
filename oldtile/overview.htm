      <p>Built upon the work of the Barrierfree project, The Inclusive Learning 
        Exchange (TILE) will establish a Learning Object Repository (LOR) service 
        that responds to the individual needs of the learner.This project will 
        act as an exemplar of inclusive e-learning and form the basis of extensions 
        to international e-learning specifications. By making broadband e-learning 
        inclusive of people with disabilities TILE will advance e-learning functionality 
        for all learners. </p>
      <p>The Inclusive Learning Exchange will advance LOR technology to the next 
        level by developing the authoring tools, repository architecture, and 
        preference schema needed to support this learner-centric transformation. 
        The service will be implemented across Canada by a network of learning 
        communities from many sectors. TILE will respond to individual needs of 
        the learner, with functionality extended to other media types used in 
        e-learning (hypertext, various xml formats, animation, simulations, Java 
        and others) and to additional learner-centric transformations and adaptations. 
      </p>
      <p>The overall project goal is to serve learners in Canada who require a 
        learner-centric approach to education using the opportunities afforded 
        by broadband networked learning and thereby influence technical developers 
        and international interoperability specification bodies to adopt more 
        inclusive approaches to e-learning.</p>

        <h2><a name="target" id="target">Target Audience</a></h2>
      </div>
      <p>The developments in this project are critical to any learner or learning 
        context that does not fit the model of the typical student and the typical 
        learning environment. This includes learners with disabilities, with unique 
        learning styles, using atypical client devices, learning in unusual environments 
        and learners approaching the topic from different perspectives or knowledge 
        backgrounds.<br />
        <br />
        The Inclusive Learning Exchange includes communities of learners who have 
        been marginalized by conventional education systems in Canada. Among these 
        communities are learners with disabilities, learners enrolled in adult 
        literacy programmes, transitional programmes and academic upgrading programmes 
        . TILE will provide an opportunity to pool, share, re-purpose and collaboratively 
        or cumulatively author accessible learning content. Through its many partners, 
        the project will addresses learners in K to 12, in post-secondary institutions, 
        in the workplace and adult learners seeking academic upgrading. </p>
      <div class="returntop">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</div>
      <div class="title">
        <h2><a name="team" id="team">Project Team</a></h2>
      </div>
      <p>A number of learning communities will participate in designing tools, 
        developing content, implementing the service within their community and 
        evaluating learning outcomes. These include: Frontier College, the National 
        Adult Literacy Database, Special Needs Opportunity Windows and its network 
        of over 20 organizations concerned with educating learners with disabilities, 
        the Transitional Year Programme at the University of Toronto, the Independent 
        Learning Centre, the Canadian Deafness and Training Institute, the Centre 
        of Excellence for Research in Immigration and Settlement and Canadian 
        Learning Television. </p>
      <p>Infrastructure Support will be provided by the Community Access Programme 
        and its associated Web4All programme, by providing broadband internet 
        access points to under-serviced communities across Canada. </p>
      <p>Formative and summative usability evaluations and learning outcome evaluations 
        will be coordinated by Ryerson University and the Ontario Institute for 
        Studies in Education at the University of Toronto. Accessibility evaluations 
        will be performed by ATRC&#8217;s WebSavvy service. </p>
      <p>WebCT will integrate the technologies developed by TILE into their software 
        and services, Adaptive Tutoring will integrate the accessibility components 
        developed into their product line (see descriptions above).</p>

      <p>One of the opportunities afforded by broadband networks is a highly responsive 
        dynamic web interface. Broadband networks open the communication channel 
        in both directions, enabling educational servers that can respond to each 
        individual learner and learning context in a timely manner. With the right 
        tools this provides the opportunity to introduce a new level of learner-centric 
        education that is inclusive of all learners.<br />
        The project will demonstrate the potential benefits of personalized courseware 
        for the learner and the impact this would have on the educator or content 
        producer. Through this project we hope to demonstrate the practical boundaries 
        of transformable content and the tools needed to support the mastery of 
        learner customizable teaching.</p>
