        <h2>REPORT ON FIRST COMMUNITY POTLUCK</h2>
        <p> Wendy Porch<br />
          February 28, 2003</p>
      </div>
      <p>Theme: "Shaping Content" </p>
      <p>On February 28, 2003, participants gathered at the University of Toronto 
        for the first of four TILE Community Potluck events coordinated by the 
        Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC). Community potlucks are slated 
        to occur once every quarter and are intended to provide partners and those 
        interested in e-learning from the larger community the opportunity to 
        collaborate and exchange information related to learning object repositories, 
        transformable content and their impact on e-learning. </p>
      <p>Representatives from the ATRC, Canadian Learning Television, Trent University, 
        Ryerson University and University of Guelph's Universal Instructional 
        Design Project were among those participating in the potluck. Jutta Treviranus, 
        director of the ATRC, presented participants with an introduction to the 
        activities for the day, and oriented participants to the theme of the 
        potluck "Shaping Content" through a thought provoking presentation. She 
        challenged participants to explore the idea of reusable, transformable 
        e-learning content. She asked participants to consider questions such 
        as "How small could a learning object be and still be useful?" and "What 
        is important to know about re-shaping existing content to meet new needs?" 
        She further elaborated the idea of reusability in learning objects through 
        a vivid example utilizing toy Lego blocks, illustrating that each block 
        could be used together with other blocks in innumerable custom combinations 
        to build unique end products. The TILE project's learning repository will 
        incorporate the authoring tools, repository architecture, and preference 
        schema needed to support assembling learning objects to create content 
        across multiple contexts, according to the learners' needs and preferences. 
      </p>
      <p>Partners then made progress reports, as did the technical and administrative 
        staff from the ATRC. Project partners present reported on efforts made 
        to identify suitable candidates for transformable content to be used as 
        learning objects in the TILE repository. Anastasia Cheetham, the project's 
        technical lead, also provided participants with an overview of technical 
        achievements and challenges so far in the project. ATRC technical staff 
        have been making great progress in their development of the authoring 
        tools, repository architecture, and preference schema deliverables for 
        the project. </p>
      <p>As the theme of this first community potluck was "Shaping Content" participants 
        in attendance took part in a learning exercise aimed at introducing those 
        present to the idea of shaping content using learning objects. Participants 
        were asked ahead of time to supply an ingredient to a potluck "dish" in 
        the form of a learning object related to the topic of time management. 
        Learning objects provided by participants ranged from simple text-based 
        articles on the topic of time management to web-based study time calculators 
        to a video taped episode of Help TV focussed on assisting people to better 
        manage their time. Participants were then split up into groups, with each 
        group supplied with a basket of the ingredients and instructions to develop 
        an online learning module using the objects provided. By way of providing 
        some instruction and focus, groups were given a short learning template 
        that provided instructional design hints suggesting they define their 
        audience first, and develop some overall learning objectives. However, 
        the specifics of the content's design and use were up to the groups to 
        determine on their own. </p>
      <p>After receiving instructions for the exercise, participants split off 
        into their small groups and began development. Present in each of the 
        groups were participant observers who were also using the exercise as 
        a way to extract information about how people approach this type of problem 
        in order to inform the design of the project's deliverables. The groups 
        worked collaboratively to identify their particular audiences' characteristics, 
        learning objectives and learning outcomes. They then developed a skeleton 
        format for their time management module using the learning objects provided. 
        After lunch, a representative from each of the four groups presented their 
        time management module designs to the larger group. </p>
      <p>The results of this potluck exercise were surprising in both their diversity 
        and level of sophistication. All of the groups employed at least five 
        of the common learning objects, but to varying ends and applications. 
        Each group individually developed different intended audiences, different 
        learning objectives and different methods of integrating the learning 
        objects provided. For example, one group developed an online time management 
        workshop entitled "Time Management for Undergraduates", while another's 
        was entitled "An Introduction to Time Management "A course for busy professionals!" 
        To view the results of this exercise, please see the list below:</p>

          Workshop</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="potluck/group3tilethingie.ppt">Introduction to Time Management 
          "A course for busy professionals!"</a> </li>
        <li> <a href="potluck/TimeManagementfortheUndergraduate.doc">Time Management 
          for the Undergraduate (Time Flies when you're having fun)</a> </li>
      </ul>
      <p>This collaborative content development exercise provided those present 
        with a hands-on example of how the same learning objects can easily be 
        re-purposed to suit different learner needs and contexts. On a much larger 
        scale, the TILE Learning Objects Repository will provide educators/content 
        developers with the opportunity to re-use and adapt a range of learning 
        objects to best meet the needs of their particular learners. </p>
      <p>For the remainder of the afternoon, discussion centred on issues raised 
        by the potluck exercise. One key question posed by many of the participants 
        related to the degree of granularity one could potentially break learning 
        objects into. One group suggested that the base unit of the learning object 
        repository be termed "a tile", with the possibility that within one large 
        learning object there could be multiple smaller "tiles'. Each tile could 
        then be connected to and built upon in combination with any of the other 
        tiles available in the learning object repository. Interoperability and 
        reusability of learning objects would enable educator/designers to access 
        a much larger pool of stored educational information and resources. This 
        sharing and interoperability of learning objects by online educators is 
        one of the key intentions of the TILE project. </p>
      <p>As learning objects would be submitted by "authors" and then potentially 
        customized or reused, the afternoon discussion also explored the development 
        of a tracking system for learning objects. Such a system may potentially 
        record who was the original author of a particular learning object, when 
        it was been submitted and what changes, if any, were made by subsequent 
        users of the material. The ATRC's technical team is currently exploring 
        the feasibility of developing such a system. </p>
      <p>The TILE Community Potluck raised several significant points for further 
        exploration and development while simultaneously providing project participants 
        with a first-hand view of the benefits of reusable transformable e-learning 
        content. Canadian Learning Television was on hand filming this TILE community 
        potluck event for use in a television spot about the project to be aired 
        at a later date. We will provide airing details for this material when 
        they are made available. </p>
      <p>Plans are in the works for our next community potluck event. Watch the 
        TILE web site for more information. </p>
