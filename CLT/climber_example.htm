      <p>As in the case of the elevator-escalator comparison, when comparing work 
        done to power generated, the results are often puzzling. Again in this 
        case work is done against gravity, and both individuals move through the 
        same vertical distance. The climber on the left, having a mass of 85 kg, 
        has to apply a greater force compared to the climber on the right, with 
        a mass of 80 kg. Since they move through the same distance, the climber 
        on the left, applying a greater force, does more work against gravity.</p>
      <p>Power is defined as the rate of doing work. That is, work done over a 
        period of time. Thus, the time it takes each climber to reach the top 
        is critical. In this case the climber on the right is much faster, as 
        a result he develops more power while doing less work.<br>
