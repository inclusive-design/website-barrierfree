      <p>Whether using an escalator or an elevator to move from one floor to the 
        next the result is the same. Both mechanical devices move a person by 
        doing work against gravity from the first to the second floor. Since gravity 
        acts vertically down, to overcome it a vertical force must be applied 
        up.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="supp_images/escalator-elevator.jpg" width="450" height="275" border="0" alt="A picture showing two floors of a building connected by both an escalator and an elevator."></p>
      <p>To determine the amount work done against gravity we multiply the magnitude 
        of the applied force by the distance through which it acts. In the case 
        of the elevator, it is easy to see that the distance between the floors 
        is to be used.</p>
      <p>Because the escalator moves the person along an incline there is the 
        question of which distance to use, along the incline or the vertical distance. 
        The key is that both distance and force must be in the same direction. 
        Since the applied force overcoming gravity is vertically up, the effective 
        distance must also be vertical and up.</p>
      <p>Therefore, in both cases the vertical distance is used to calculate the 
        work done.</p>
      <p>The escalator does more work in moving Devendra to the second floor because 
        his mass, 55 kg, is greater than Laura's at 45 kg is. The escalator does 
        1.73*10<sup>3</sup> J of work compared to the elevator's 1.41*10<sup>3</sup> 
        J, a significant difference.</p>
      <p>However, when we consider power, the rate of doing work, this example 
        makes an interesting point. Laura, using the elevator reaches the second 
        floor in 13 s, whereas it takes Devendra 25 s, almost twice as long. Using:<br>
      </p>
      <p>Power = work &divide; time</p>
      <p>We can determine the power developed by both, the elevator and the escalator.</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p><i>P</i><sub>elevator</sub> = <i>W</i><sub>elevator</sub> &divide; 
          <i>t</i><sub>elevator</sub><br>
          <i>P</i><sub>elevator</sub> = 1.41 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> J &divide; 
          13 s<br>
          <i>P</i><sub>elevator</sub> = 108 J/s<br>
          <i>P</i><sub>elevator</sub> = 1.1 &times; 10<sup>2</sup> W</p>
        <p><i>P</i><sub>escalator</sub> = <i>W</i><sub>escalator</sub> &divide; 
          <i>t</i><sub>escalator</sub><br>
          <i>P</i><sub>escalator</sub> = 1.73 &times; 10<sup>3</sup> J &divide; 
          25 s<br>
          <i>P</i><sub>escalator</sub> = 69.2 J/s<br>
          <i>P</i><sub>escalator</sub> = 69<sup></sup> W</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>Clearly the elevator developed more power by doing less work much faster. 
        Power depends on how fast work is done.</p>
