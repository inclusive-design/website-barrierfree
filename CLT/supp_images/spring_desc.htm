A coiled spring is standing upright in the middle of the screen. Beside it, is 
the label, <i>E</i><sub>p</sub> = 0, indicating that the potential energy of the 
spring is zero before any pressure is applied to it. Then an arrow labelled F, 
for force, pushes down from above, compressing the coils of the spring until the 
spring is half its original height. At that point the label changes to <i>E</i><sub>p</sub> 
&gt; 0 to indicate that the spring is now storing potential energy.
