<p>The animation begins blank. Then a piece of carbon paper appears, viewed from 
  the side, at the bottom of the image. Then a piece of newsprint appears above 
  it. Then the puck appears. It is drawn as a cutaway with a flexible tube extending 
  down from the top of the screen to just above the newsprint. On either side 
  of the tube, the puck extends out so that its surface area is increased. Then 
  arrows show how the air flows down the tube and out between the newsprint and 
  the extended sides of the puck. The pressure of the air lifts the puck off the 
  paper, where it hovers with very little friction. Then an electrode at the end 
  of a chain is dropped down inside the pipe. Electrical pulses travel along the 
  chain and into the electrode where they leap across the gap to the table, through 
  the newsprint and the carbon paper. The result is a dot of carbon on the newsprint. 
  If the puck is in motion, the dots will leave a record of its path. This is 
  shown in the next image in the animation in which the puck cutaway is removed 
  and a track of dots is shown. The dots are a record of the air table pendulum. 
  At the start, the puck moves slowly so the dots are tightly packed together. 
  But, as the puck accelerates down the table the dots get further and further 
  apart. However, once the puck starts to swing back up, its speed decreases and 
  the dots become closer and closer. The final result is that the path of dots 
  is symmetric on either side of the low point in the curve. The low point is 
  labelled (<i>E</i><sub>k</sub>)<sub>maximum</sub>, maximum kinetic energy, and 
  one of the high points is labelled (<i>E</i><sub>p</sub>)<sub>maximum</sub>, 
  maximum potential energy.</p>
