<p>The animation begins with a large right triangle in the middle of the screen. 
  The triangle represents the air table and it forms a ramp that begins with a 
  point on the left and rises to the right. At the bottom right, the triangle 
  has a right angle. The height of the air table triangle at it's highest point, 
  on the right, is labelled <i>h</i><sub>table</sub>. The angle of the ramp is 
  labelled &Oslash;.</p>
<p>Next, two pucks appear at different heights on the air table surface. They 
  represent the puck at the top and bottom of its swing.</p>
<p>Then arrows and text appear that label the length of the triangle hypotenuse 
  as ltable. The distance along the air table between the two pucks is labelled 
  lpuck.</p>
<p>Then a smaller triangle is formed by drawing a horizontal line across from 
  the puck at the lower-left and a vertical line down from the puck at the upper-right. 
  The hypotenuse of this smaller triangle is the part of the air table surface 
  between the two pucks. The height of the small triangle is labelled hpuck and 
  the angle of its hypothenuse is labelled &Oslash;.</p>
<p>Finally, the pucks disappear and the smaller triangle slides down the large 
  triangle until the the two angles labelled &Oslash; fit together perfectly. 
  This demonstrates that the two triangles are similar.</p>
