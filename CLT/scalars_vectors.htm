      <p><strong>Scalar:</strong> Any quantity that can be completely described 
        by its size, magnitude, and units is a scalar quantity; e.g., mass, energy, 
        speed, and distance.</p>
      <p><strong>Vector:</strong> Any quantity that must be described by its size 
        and a direction as well as units is a vector quantity; e.g., weight, force, 
        velocity, displacement.</p>
      <p>So, speed is a scalar. But, speed with direction (velocity) is a vector. 
        Distance is a scalar, but distance with direction (displacement) is a 
        vector. In this example the bag moves along the horizontal, its displacement 
        is its change in position in the horizontal plane.</p>
