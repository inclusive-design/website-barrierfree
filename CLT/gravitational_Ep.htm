      <p>An object or system with potential energy has the potential to do work. 
        This may be due to its position or condition. Gravitational potential 
        energy is an example of potential energy due to position. The potential 
        energy is equal to the work done against gravity to place the object into 
        its position relative to some arbitrarily chosen reference level. In the 
        escalator and elevator examples the first floor is the reference level, 
        and the gain in potential energy is equal to the work done against gravity 
        in moving the two students to the second floor.</p>
      <p align="center"><img src="supp_images/desk-computers.jpg" width="450" height="275" border="0" alt="A picture showing a computer sitting on the floor. Beside it stands a desk on which sits another identical computer. Both computers are labelled as being 8 kilograms and thje height of the desk is labelled at 0.75 metres."></p>
      <p>In this example we express the computer's gravitational potential energy 
        as a value relative to the floor, our chosen reference level. Therefore, 
        the computer has zero gravitational potential energy on the floor and 
        some gravitational potential energy on the tabletop. On the tabletop it 
        has the potential to do work due to its position.</p>
      <p>We can calculate this potential energy using:</p>
      <blockquote> 
        <p> <i>E</i><sub>p</sub> = <i>mgh</i><br>
          <em>E</em><sub>p</sub> = 8.0 kg &times; 9.81 m/s<sup>2</sup> &times; 0.75 m<br>
          <em>E</em><sub>p</sub> = 55 J</p>
      </blockquote>
      <p>The use of this equation is only valid for situations near the surface 
        of Earth. Here Earth's gravity dominates all other gravitational effects, 
        and the distance <i>h</i> is relatively small to the distance from the 
        centre of Earth. This allows us to consider <i>g</i>, which changes with 
        the distance from Earth's centre, to be constant.</p>
