This paper         describes a project that uses enhanced access tools to provide interactivity         and personalization of learning materials for learners with or without         disabilities. It is hoped that access tools will become an essential and         not special component of all broadband learning environments.</p>      <hr>      <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>      <h2>The Context</h2>      <p>Television and the Web are converging. For educational TV broadcasters         this opens the possibility for new learning paradigms. Access tools such         as captioning and video description provide an ideal vehicle for interactivity         as well as a method of accommodating a large range of learning styles         and levels. The Adaptive Technology Resource Centre in collaboration with         Canadian Learning Television and eight partner organizations is developing         tools that will establish captioning and video description as essential         components of interactive educational video over broadband for all learners.</p>      <h2>Combining the Old with the New</h2>      <p>Educational broadcasters have predominantly used a lecturer paradigm,         augmented with audio-visual demonstrations. This paradigm was well suited         to the unidirectional nature of broadcasting. When done well, this approach         combined entertainment, story-telling and theatre to engage the learner.         Unfortunately, due to its linear and inflexible nature there are many         instances where learning breaks down when using this approach. This breakdown         can be attributed to communication problems: &quot;I didn't hear an important         concept, I missed part of an argument, I don't understand a word or term         used.&quot; It can be due to a mismatch in the assumptions regarding the         prior knowledge of the learner: &quot;What do you mean by terminal velocity.&quot;         It can be due to a mismatch in learning styles: &quot;Can you show me         that rather than describing it. Can you illustrate it in another way.&quot;         It can be due to a mismatch in pace: &quot;You're going too fast, you've         lost me. You're going too slow, I'm bored.&quot; Whatever the cause of         the breakdown, once the learner is disengaged from the process it is very         difficult to pick up the threads again to achieve the learning goals.</p>      <p>The quality and quantity of learning material produced by educational         broadcasters is very impressive. At a time when we are searching for content         for on-line learning, educational videos offer a rich store of resources         if we can successfully adapt and re-purpose them in an on-line environment.</p>      <p>The overall goal of the project entitled &quot;Creating Barrier-free         Broadband Learning Environments,&quot; is to identify potential barriers         to access in broadband education delivery systems for learners with disabilities,         develop solutions to the barriers, advance alternative or multi-modal         display and control mechanisms that are only possible in broadband environments         and create tools that allow learners to customize the learning experience         to their individual learning styles and needs. In meeting these goals         the project will also develop a means of creatively re-purposing quality         traditional educational programming while addressing the problems that         cause breakdown in learning.</p>      <hr>     <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>      <h2>The Essential Role of Captioning</h2>      <p>A general objective of the project is to adapt the material to meet the         needs of the broadest range of learners, both from an equal access perspective         and from a knowledge level perspective (e.g., making college level physics         accessible to grade 9 students); and to make it highly interactive and         responsive to the specific needs of the learner. Captioning plays an essential         role in this objective. The verbatim captions are used for several purposes.         Captioning is used to structure and markup the video. This structure is         then used to navigate within the video and to condense or expand the material.         For example, if a learner wants to go back to every mention of a specific         term, the caption would be used to sort the start time codes for the segments.</p>      <p>The traditional &quot;Line 21&quot; captioning is replaced with enhanced         multimedia overlay captions. Standard captions are limited to text and         restricted to either the bottom or top of the screen. This makes it difficult         to communicate the source of the sound or speech, it also makes it very         difficult to communicate non-speech sound-based information such as inflection,         tone of voice, speech rate, music, and other non-speech sounds. By allowing         multimedia overlay captioning, comic book conventions can be adopted to         indicate the source of sound. Color, animation and graphics can be used         to indicate affect, music and non-speech sounds. A video window can be         invoked to provide ASL/LSQ translation. Captions can also be used to label         visual objects or highlight a part of the video frame.</p>      <p>Most importantly the captions will be used for hyper-linking. Thus if         the learner wants more information about a term, a definition, background         material, related material or an interactive exercise that further illustrates         a concept, they would click on the term or phrase in the caption which         would pause the video and take them to the supportive material.</p>      <h2>Tell Me More with Video Descriptions</h2>      <p>Video description, beyond making the video accessible to learners who         are blind, will be used to elucidate, provide further detail or clarify.         Thus for a learner having difficulty in following the steps in a chemistry         experiment, the video description would elucidate the steps in greater         detail than provided by the original video.</p>      <p>Putting these pieces together you can imagine the following scenario:         &quot;Watching a physics lecture by an eminent physicist, a phenomenon         is referred to that you know little about, you turn on captioning and         click on the term in the text caption, this links you to a definition         of the term. To find out more about the phenomenon referred to you click         on an interactive exercise that illustrates the concept. To better understand         the forces at play you turn on haptic rendering and use your force feedback         joystick to feel what is happening. Once you are confident that you understand         the term you return to the lecture. The lecturer moves to a demonstration,         some of which you find difficult to follow, you turn on descriptive video         which provides a subnarrative in the audio pauses further describing what         is happening. For additional help you turn on overlay captions that provide         text labels of the objects and processes occurring in the demonstration.         You control the interface using a simple set of voice commands.&quot;</p>      <hr>      <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>      <h2>Education that Fits the Learner</h2>      <p>One important step in preventing the breakdown of learning is to insure         that the education fits the learner. The learner should be able to customize         the amount and type of background given, the detail or verbosity of the         dialogue, the reading level required to follow the material, the pace         of the teaching/learning, the methods used to demonstrate concepts, and         the learning outcomes to be achieved (e.g., the general theory versus         applying the actual algorithm). A properly structured broadband learning         environment should allow this customization.</p>      <h2>XML Schema and Practicing what we Preach</h2>      <p>To allow customization of the learning material the ATRC and its partners         are creating <a href="http://www.w3.org/XML">XML</a> schema for Captioning         and Video Description. The schema will be partially based upon the DAISY         standard. The XML schema combined with XSLT style sheets will allow user         specification of how captions are displayed (e.g., font, color, position,         hyperlink, etc.). A Meta-tagging scheme (based upon international learning         object meta-tagging standards) will be developed to allow the storage         and retrieval of caption tracks for different reading levels, languages,         levels of verbosity, etc. A similar classification will be possible for         the video description audio tracks. Thus a learner can take a specific         lesson, choose a caption track suited to their reading level, displayed         the way they want it, with the desired level of description in both the         captioning and video description, and the desired amount and type of background         material in-line and linked to the lesson. Alternatively, a teacher can         re-purpose a lesson for the needs of a specific class, allowing further         individual customization for specific students.</p>      <h2>The Necessary Tools</h2>      <p>To make the above described scenario possible the ATRC and its partners         are developing a number of tools. These include the authoring tools needed         to create the enhanced captioning and video description, the browser/viewer         required to specify user preferences and view the enhanced materials and         the learning repository needed to store and retrieve the associated learning         objects.</p>      <p>The enhanced caption and video description authoring and mark-up tools         will be created as modular components to be added to existing video authoring         tools for the web. The files created will be SMIL compliant. Initially,         Quicktime sprites will be used to create the more advanced interactive         components. It is hoped that Magpie, developed by <a href="http://www.wgbh.org/wgbh/pages/ncam/">NCAM</a>         can act as the base for the caption authoring tool. To make the authoring         process realistic for the typical educator a number of intelligent preprocessing         and script or text track management tools will be included.</p>      <p>To allow the expression of user preferences and to allow the assembly         of learning objects on the fly based upon the user preferences a browser/viewer         will be created using <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/">Mozilla</a> and         XUL. Thus the learner can adapt the browser interface, the type and order         of learning objects and how they are displayed. The captions and video         descriptions would act as anchors to related resources, interactive exercises,         and other learning resources.</p>      <p>It is hoped that the functionality required of the learning repository         can be integrated into national learning repositories presently under         development. The project will model the functionality for the purposes         of the project and advocate for its inclusion with national and international         groups governing large learning repositories. Necessary functionality         includes the facility to create a number of assembly objects that can         call collections of atomic objects (caption tracks, URLs, audio description         tracks).</p>      <p>Educators and producers of learning objects would collectively contribute         to the learning repository, thereby reducing the amount of development         required for a specific learning module. Once the objects in the repository         have reached a critical mass, the objects can be reused for several learning         modules.</p>      <hr>     <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>      <h2>Conclusions</h2>      <p>The principles of both equal access and successful learning are to allow         a broad and flexible range of display, control and interaction techniques.         The terminology may have differed in the two fields but the functionality         is the same. The field of equal access has had much more experience in         implementing these principles in a technical environment. In this time         of converging technologies and shifting paradigms, we have much to teach         educators. If done correctly, access tools can become an essential and         not a special component of broadband learning environments.</p>      <h2>References</h2>      <p>Further information about the project and related material can be found         at the project web site: <a href="http://www.barrierfree.ca">http://www.barrierfree.ca</a></p>      <p></p>      <h2>Acknowledgements</h2>      <p>The project is partially funded by <a href="http://www.canarie.ca/">Canarie         Inc.</a></p>      <p>The author would like to acknowledge all project partners and staff.         For a complete list please refer to: <a href="http://www.barrierfree.ca">http://www.barrierfree.ca</a></p> <hr>     <p align="right">[<a href="#top">Return to TOP</a>]</p>      <!-- #EndEditable --><br clear="all">       <div align="center"><img src="img/footer-line.gif" width="400" height="4">         <p><a href="http://www.utoronto.ca/atrc" class="bttm">Web site hosted by the Adaptive         Technology Resource Centre <img src="img/final_atrc_logo.gif" width="84" height="59" align="middle" alt="Adaptive Technology Resource Centre Logo" border="0"></a><br>      </p></div></td>  </tr></table><span class="bttm"></span></body><!-- #EndTemplate --></html>
