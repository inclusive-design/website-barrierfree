<h2 class="blu">Overall Objectives </h2>
<p>Please provide an overall rating of the degree to which the project met its 
  objectives. Use a similar rating of 1 Ð 10, as above. </p>
<p>Rating _9_ Please provide an explanation of the rating provided. </p>
<p> The other concern that hampered meeting of the objectives was the lack of 
  access to broadband by a number of consumer partners of the project. The roll 
  out of ORIAN was delayed beyond the original timeline. This affected partners 
  in central and northern Ontario. To overcome this concern local versions of 
  the server were set up to allow implementation and evaluation. </p>
<h4>Project Contribution to Sector/Social Objectives </h4>
<p>While the contribution of the project to broad sector or social objectives 
  is not identified in the Project Agreement, it was identified in the Project 
  Proposal. Please describe the sector or social objectives which were identified 
  in the Project Proposal. </p>
<p>One sector within Canada that can benefit most from broadband delivered education 
  is learners with disabilities. Network delivered instruction is easily adapted 
  to varying learning styles, rates, and communication formats. Issues of distance, 
  transportation and physical access are reduced. Electronic text, unlike printed 
  text, can be read by individuals who are blind, vision impaired, dyslexic and 
  by individuals who cannot hold a book or turn pages. Broadband delivered multimedia 
  can be delivered synchronously in multiple formats to accommodate individuals 
  who require alternative modalities or who require more than one modality to 
  learn. </p>
<p>Learners who are presently excluded from using network based educational environments 
  due to access barriers include individuals of all ages: </p>
<ul>
  <li> who are blind and depend upon screen reading or refreshable Braille technology,</li>
  <li> who are visually impaired and require screen magnification tools,</li>
  <li> who are physically disabled and require alternatives to the keyboard and 
    mouse, and</li>
  <li> with learning disabilities who require text-to-speech and/or voice recognition 
    tools.</li>
</ul>
<p>Potential learners with disabilities make up more than 15% of the Canadian 
  population. This will increase in the next decade with the effects of an aging 
  population. </p>
<p class="right"><a href="#top"><img src="img/top.gif" width="14" height="13" alt="top"></a></p>

<p>The benefits of this project will effect more than the specified target group. 
  It is a well-known phenomenon that enhancements made to help learners with disabilities 
  will make the environment more effective for all learners. Adding tactile manipulation 
  and tactile sense to a learning environment will assist in teaching skills that 
  require manual dexterity as well as in communicating spatial concepts to learners 
  who are blind. Including voice recognition and gesture recognition as means 
  of controlling interactive learning environments will make the interface more 
  efficient and intuitive for many learners while making it possible for learners 
  with physical disabilities to participate. Captioning and descriptive video 
  have demonstrated advantages for indexing and searching learning materials. 
</p>
<p>Access to education by Canadian citizens who are frequently marginalized will 
  improve employability, as well as physical, mental and emotional health and 
  well-being, all of which bear immeasurable social and financial benefits. Inclusive 
  education delivery will help Canada overcome geographic barriers that frequently 
  place Canadian residents with disabilities in double jeopardy. </p>

<p>Given a growing awareness and respect for the human rights of people with disabilities 
  worldwide and legislative steps taken to insure access, there is a large market 
  worldwide for barrier free education tools. The United States is inevitably 
  one of the largest consumers of on-line learning products developed in Canada. 
  Both at a state level and at a federal level the US has passed stringent legislation 
  governing the accessibility of learning tools and educational content to people 
  with disabilities. At a federal level this legislation includes the Americans 
  with Disabilities Act, Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act and Section 255 
  of telecommunications legislation (many of Canada's other important trade partners 
  such as Australia and the EU are passing similar legislation). At a state level, 
  the largest states such as Texas and California have legislation and regulations 
  specifically governing the accessibility of learning content and delivery mechanisms. 
  In order to tap the US market, Canada's learning products must be accessible. 
  Learning tools that make on-line education more accessible to people with disabilities 
  will have an immediate market, in US educational institutions and in industries 
  involved in on-line delivery of learning products who must respond to legislation 
  governing access. </p>

<p>The project clearly addresses CANARIE's broad strategic objectives and the 
  objectives of the Learning Program. The technologies to be developed in this 
  project are essential to the successful implementation of broadband networks 
  for a large sector of the Canadian population. Open-systems standards are as 
  critical to accessibility as they are to inter-operability. The outcomes of 
  this project will make Canada a leader in the delivery of inclusive, barrier-free 
  education and training. The proposed technologies leverage the power of broadband 
  technologies in innovative ways to benefit all Canadian learners. </p>

<h2>Information Dissemination/Technology Transfer </h2>
<h4>Conferences/Workshops </h4>
<p>The Barrierfree project was presented at a large number of local, national 
  and international forums. These included two Canarie sponsored workshops on 
  e-learning. Both peer reviewed papers and invited papers were presented at international 
  conferences in North America, Europe and the Pacific Rim. As a primary goal 
  of this project was to influence the developers of emerging e-learning technology, 
  repeated presentations were given to international interoperability decision 
  bodies including IMS and W3C. Presentations were made at meetings of e-learning 
  specification bodies such as CETIS, the Open Knowledge Initiative, OKI, and 
  the Educational Modeling Language Intitiative (EML). Over the course of the 
  project, presentations were made to well over 2,000 individuals, from across 
  the globe and representing all sectors. </p>
