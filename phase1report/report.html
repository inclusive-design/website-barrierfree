<h2>Project Team </h2>
<p>The project team has broad sectorial and geographic representation. The team 
  drew together leaders in the field of academic technology access, forerunners 
  in national educational broadcasting, cutting-edge innovators in information 
  technology, and national consumer groups. The team members represent university-based 
  research programs, Canadian corporations, Canadian Small Medium Enterprises 
  and national public sector partners. </p>
<p>The project team is made up of: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Canadian Learning Television</li>
  <li> Adaptive Technology Resource Centre, University of Toronto</li>
  <li> Centre for Learning Technologies, Ryerson Polytechnic University</li>
  <li> Canadian National Institute for the Blind Library (CNIB)</li>
  <li> Canadian Hearing Society (CHS)</li>
  <li> National Educational Association of Disabled Students (NEADS)</li>
  <li> Marblemedia Inc. </li>
</ul>
<h2>Acknowledgements</h2>
<p> The project participants wish to acknowledge CANARIE Inc. for the support 
  provided to the project, the IMS Global Learning Consortium for the forum to 
  communicate the issues raised by the project and begin to effect change within 
  the field, and the many informal partners who assisted in steering and furthering 
  the project goals. </p>
<h2>Project Description </h2>
<p>The transition to broadband networks represents a risk and an opportunity for 
  people with disabilities. On the one hand, broadband networks provide a flexible 
  vehicle whereby innovative display and control alternatives can be offered that 
  afford access to users with a range of skills and needs. The interactive mechanisms 
  that will be available over broadband networks will allow learners to customize 
  the presentation of the learning materials (the pacing, the order, the modality, 
  etc) while retaining a rich, engaging learning experience. Broadband will also 
  allow the transmission of multiple modalities synchronously (video, audio, haptics, 
  text, graphics), thereby accommodating learners who need alternative display 
  modalities or several display modalities at one time. The risk presented by 
  the move from restricted bandwidth networks to broadband networks is that content 
  developers lose an important motivation to include equivalent alternatives to 
  multimedia content. To date, steps taken by content providers to accommodate 
  users with bandwidth restrictions, legacy browsers or mobile client software 
  (eg, text alternatives, no-frame options, structural markup, etc.) have also 
  made the content accessible to people with disabilities. To ensure that the 
  move to broadband networks does not exclude a large portion of Canadian learners, 
  inclusive tools and mechanisms need to be developed at the outset. </p>
<p>The overall goal of the Barrierfree project was to: identify potential barriers 
  to access in broadband education delivery systems for learners with disabilities, 
  develop solutions to the barriers, advance alternative or multi-modal display 
  and control mechanisms that are only possible in broadband environments and 
  create tools that allow learners to customize the learning experience to their 
  individual learning styles and needs. </p>
<p><a href="#top"><img src="img/top.gif" width="14" height="13" align="right" alt="top"></a></p>

<p>The project addressed these goals by meeting the following objectives, to: 
</p>


<ul>
  <li> Advance captioning technology by developing more effective means of producing, 
    transmitting and displaying captions and by enhancing the types of captions 
    available within a broadband context. </li>
  <li> Advance methods of producing, transmitting and displaying descriptive video.</li>
  <li> Develop mechanisms to author and deliver haptic learning objects over broadband 
    networks.</li>
  <li> Create a user preference system for content display and control. </li>
  <li> Create a browser/viewer to accommodate the enhanced curriculum.</li>
  <li> Design a data store and architecture for storing, indexing and retrieving 
    the learning objects.</li>
  <li> Create an authoring tool that integrates the necessary access tools, and. 
  </li>
  <li> Develop and evaluate demonstration content that integrates the innovative 
    technologies developed through the project.</li>
</ul>

<p>These developments represent innovative advances in broadband delivered education 
  that will benefit all learners and broaden the scope of subjects that can be 
  effectively taught at a distance. They utilize the unique possibilities of broadband 
  to bridge barriers and provide new opportunities to learners with disabilities 
  while making the learning experience more interactive and engaging for all learners. 
</p>
<p>Learners who are presently excluded from using network based educational environments 
  due to access barriers include individuals of all ages: </p>
<ul style="square">
  <li> who are blind and depend upon screen reading or refreshable Braille technology, 
  </li>
  <li> who are visually impaired and require screen magnification tools,</li>
  <li> who are physically disabled and require alternatives to the keyboard and 
    mouse, and </li>
  <li> with learning disabilities, who require text-to-speech and/or voice recognition 
    tools. </li>
</ul>
<p>Potential learners with disabilities make up more than 15% of the Canadian 
  population. This will increase in the next decade with the effects of an aging 
  population. Given a growing awareness and respect for the human rights of people 
  with disabilities worldwide and legislative steps taken to insure access, there 
  is a large market worldwide for barrier free education tools. </p>
<p>Development of broadband delivered education systems in Canada is at a critical 
  juncture: conventions can be established that exclude a large sector of the 
  Canadian population or conventions can be adopted that make education possible 
  for many Canadians who have been previously excluded. If proactive steps are 
  taken now, barrier-free education can be a naturally integrated component of 
  broadband education delivery. This project has begun this proactive process 
  and has established Canada as a leader in inclusive on-line education in many 
  international forums. </p>
