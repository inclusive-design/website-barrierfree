      The Functional Specification was drafted over the course of many meetings, 
      in consultation with representatives of the various target users of the 
      deliverables of this project. The Technical Specification was drafted through 
      a number of meetings of the technical team. The Functional and Technical 
      Specifications were used to develop an Implementation Plan which was continually 
      updated throughout the progress of the project.</td>

      30 minutes each) and one life skills series (“Room for Five”, Language Arts, 
      8 episodes, 30 minutes each). Various digitization formats were evaluated, 
      and a balance between resolution and compression was selected to allow transmission 
      over equipment available to the test sites with enough quality and resolution 
      to allow modeling of advanced captioning and descriptive video. The material 
      was cleared for copyright, and digitized. In addition to this deliverable, 
      work on the Technical Specification and Implementation Plan continued, and 
      work began on the technical deliverables. </td>

        <dd>This DTD was designed for the markup of the verbatim text caption, 
          to encode the timing of the captions, and to allow for enhancement of 
          the content with hyperlinks to supplementary information. The schema 
          also incorporates a mechanism for embedding a navigational structure 
          into the caption, and encoding speaker identification. 
        <dt>assemblyobject.dtd: 
        <dd> This DTD identifies the structure of an assembly object, which is 
          a collection of various media object references. The DTD includes duration 
          information, and references to the metadata for the various media elements. 
        <dt> preferences.dtd: 
        <dd> This DTD encapsulates the learner’s content preferences, including 
          the selection and presentation of text captions, audio description, 
          annotations, and on-screen presentation of navigational information, 
          and user settings.

    <td rowspan="8">The deliverables of Caption Overlay Tool, Video Description 
      Tool and Caption Markup were combined into a single stand alone application, 
      the Authoring Tool, which provided both caption and video description functionalities. 
      Originally, we intended to incorporate the Captioning and Video Description 
      technology into existing multimedia and captioning tools (Creator, by Expresto, 
      and VoiceWriter by Haylea), however user evaluations of these tools led 
      to the recommendation that we create a stand-alone tool with a simplified 
      interface. The design of the Authoring Tool began in Phase 4, and implementation 
      was completed in Phase 5. The Viewer/Browser was implemented as a standalone 
      application referred to as the Player. The User Preference System was actually 
      designed to function as a Preference System used by both the Authoring Tool 
      and the Player. It encodes the learner’s content preferences as XML according 
      to the schema described above, and specified in Appendix B. Both the learner 
      style preferences and the author styles are recorded recorded according 
      the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) specification.</td>

    <td rowspan="8">The Core Software Library was designed during Phase 5, and 
      implementation was completed during Phase 6. The core is a foundation for 
      other aspects of the project including the Player, the Authoring Tool, and 
      the Repository. The core provides a means of reading, writing, and editing 
      the various XML files used to describe the content of the presentation. 
      In essence, the core code provides a set of Java objects for manipulation 
      the XML. The Preferences System was not converted to a standalone application. 
      It was implemented as a library used by both the Authoring Tool and the 
      Player. The details are described above, in the description of Phase 5 deliverables. 
      The ASL Video deliverable was expanded in order to help determine how broadband 
      systems can help to overcome some of the problems of traditional broadcast 
      ASL translation. An additional partner, MarbleMedia, was added. A series 
      of American Sign Language (ASL) videos were produced that addressed various 
      approaches to dealing with these challenges, and a new method of providing 
      equivalent information was developed following extensive user input. Three 
      10 minute segments were created incorporating feedback from several iterative 
      revisions. </td>
