<h4 class="blu">Results and Discussion</h4>
<p>The player underwent several stages of evaluation. The initial stages were 
  iterative and the resulting issue reports informed the ongoing development of 
  the player tool. Testing with focus-groups enabled the investigators to identify 
  further issues of access or player use that are specifically related to mode 
  of access or disability. After further development, usability testing with specific 
  user groups was carried out. </p>
<p>All of the usability test participants reported that they were daily computer 
  users. Furthermore 12 of the 17 participants reported that they were somewhat 
  (7) or very familiar (5) with their computer video player. Only five of the 
  participants had taken a web-based course before. All of the participants were 
  given three content questions (see p. 51) to answer that would force the participant 
  to use different player features in order to find the answer. The results showed 
  that all of the participants were able to try hyperlinks to additional material. 
  However, linking for the blind participants was very difficult and brought forward 
  some issues related to using the player with screen readers (e.g. inability 
  to have links read out, difficulty accessing some windows). These were communicated 
  to the development team. Most of the participants struggled with a formula content 
  question although 15 of the participants did navigate correctly to the calculations 
  content page that contained the link to the correct answer. Once again participants 
  who were blind were not able to navigate to the answer. These findings show 
  that participants (excluding those using screen readers) were able to successfully 
  navigate through the course content and any difficulty finding the correct answer 
  was more likely due to the question rather than user navigation abilities.</p>
<p>The content questions of the session helped us to understand how participants 
  used the player features in their learning as well as to identify further uses 
  for the video accommodations. For example, all of the participants used the 
  captions to search for answers. A variety of methods were employed from stepping 
  through the captions using the video controls, or by reading and/or searching 
  the full text of the captions. Several participants who were not hard of hearing 
  and therefore not reliant on captions reported that they liked having captions 
  with the video. This finding demonstrates the widespread benefit of inclusive 
  design where an accommodation such as captions for one user group has benefits 
  for other groups as well. Transcriptions of the verbal protocol from each session 
  were made and used to create issue reports for the development team. These reports 
  include user likes, dislikes and difficulties with the player. Software is typically 
  used in ways that is not foreseen by the developers and this protocol helps 
  to inform the team of the rationale behind user decisions as well as expose 
  difficulties experienced by the user (see pp. 52 & 53 for examples). </p>

</p>
<p><i>Authoring Tool Evaluation Evaluation Process</i> </p>
<p>Our goal was to evaluate the usability of the authoring tool as described in 
  section 2. Three stages of evaluation of the authoring tool were planned: heuristic 
  evaluation, beta testing and usability testing. Unfortunately, time constraints 
  restricted full usability testing of the authoring tool. The identified test 
  group was educators who already utilize the internet for delivery of course 
  material. A number of this group were unable to set aside the required time 
  to review and try the authoring tool at the beginning of the school year. However, 
  a heuristic evaluation and beta testing was carried out. </p>
<p><i>Methods Heuristic Evaluation</i> </p>
<p>The evaluation of the authoring tool also followed the usability heuristics 
  developed by Jakob Nielson (1994). These heuristics are outlined on page 42 
  of this report. Beta Testing Further evaluation of the authoring tool involved 
  beta-testing of the player by usability experts. Researchers used and analysed 
  the authoring tool in the role of educators or course developers. The analysis 
  included usability heuristics, user expectations, and intuitiveness. From this 
  data, an issue and bug report was created and given to the development team. 
</p>
<p><i>Results and Discussion</i> </p>
<p>The evaluation of the authoring tool identified 12 issues (see p. 56). Once 
  an issue was identified a suggestion for addressing the issue was made and reported 
  to the development team. Although full summative user-testing could not be carried 
  out within the project time-frame, initial evaluation shows that the authoring 
  tool is not complicated to use and compilation of new and existing media tracks 
  is intuitive. There were some issues around the use of technical language that 
  confuse novice users. Changes to the current structure of the meta-data input 
  were recommended. Meta-data is a particularly important component for the sharing 
  of learning objects and requires precise language and categories. A simple but 
  structured means to draw the relevant information from learning object creators 
  that will then automatically populate the meta-data fields was recommended. 
</p>
<p><i>Impact on project </i> </p>
<p>The results of all of the evaluations provided a significant contribution to 
  the project. The formative evaluations for the player and the authoring tool 
  provided valuable information during the development cycle when it was simpler 
  and less expensive to make changes. Issues discovered during the evaluation 
  process informed and helped developers to make design improvements and decisions 
  that were best suited to users. It is often difficult for developers to predict 
  user reaction to and usability of designs particularly when target user populations 
  are so diverse. As a result of the evaluations, the player and authoring tools 
  can be successfully used by people who are deaf, hard of hearing, vision impaired, 
  learning disabled and others. </p>

</p>
<p><i>Impact on community </i></p>
<p>The evaluation carried out to explore alternative presentation and customized 
  controls for American Sign Language translations of video material did not inform 
  the design of the player or authoring tools but it did provide important information 
  about customized controls and ASL preferences for video. </p>
<p>Shared with the partners in the Barrier-free project, The Canadian Hearing 
  Society’s mission is to provide services that enhance the independence of deaf, 
  deafened and hard of hearing people and that encourage prevention of hearing 
  loss. The implications of and results from the ASL portion of the Barrier-Free 
  project, will greatly enhance the independence of the Deaf. </p>
<p>We were interested in finding ways that could better enhance the comprehension 
  of online material for deaf individuals. Deaf individuals have a right to receive 
  information in their native language – sign language. It is also their right 
  to access video material that has the same richness and entertainment value 
  as with an oral video. Many people assume that written material including closed 
  captions is sufficient for the Deaf. In majority of cases this is not so and 
  therefore we needed to explore options for access to video material. </p>
<p>The experimental results show that the Deaf are interested in new variations 
  of video formats (rather than the conventional closed captioning). Having these 
  formats available online will allow deaf individuals to have improved educational 
  opportunities such as online distance courses. It will also allow content developers 
  to produce effective ASL translations of their video material. It also demonstrated 
  that customizable formatting for ASL display spaces is desirable and worthwhile 
  including in player or presentation systems, although a complete cost-benefit 
  analysis remains to be carried out to determine the most cost effective. </p>
<p>The Internet has become an essential communication tool for the Deaf. By developing 
  and delivering web-based material in sign language the potential is immeasurable. 
  Educational courses online could be translated into any sign language (over 
  100 around the world). Important government forms (often difficult to comprehend) 
  could be explained in sign language with a glossary of difficult terms explained 
  in sign language as well. Deaf individuals with lower levels of literacy often 
  rely on interpreters, family, friends, volunteers and CHS counsellors to explain 
  how to fill out forms such as the annual income tax forms. With explanations 
  in sign language, these deaf individuals would rely less on others and increase 
  their independence. </p>
<p>The impact on other communities of people with disabilities is also significant 
  with the development and deployment of the player and authoring tools. Not only 
  is the Internet important for people who are Deaf but also it is important to 
  a wide range of communities who find access to traditional or conventional learning 
  systems difficult or cumbersome. The player and authoring tool have been design 
  and evaluated with various populations of users and found to be accessible and 
  usable. </p>
<p>Allowing content designers and creators to easily produce accessible on-line 
  learning material for many different types of learners increases the potential 
  benefit to all users as evidenced by the use of the closed captions in our experiments. 
  It also means that on-line content can meet legislative requirements and standards 
  for accessibility. </p>
