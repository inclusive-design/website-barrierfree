<h4>Analysis</h4>
<p><i>Verbal Protocol Analysis</i><br />
  A protocol for assessing the transcriptions was developed based on the study 
  objectives. As shown in Table 6, eight categories were established with six 
  categories having positive or negative as subcategories. One category coded 
  direct comparisons between the two translation types and the last category was 
  a simple count (see 50 for categories and a sample comments). Due to technical 
  failures, only 13 participants have full data sets and only these full sets 
  are included in the analysis. Five of the participants viewed the ASL video 
  first. Also, only the analysis of the verbal protocols collected during the 
  two video viewing sessions is reported here. </p>
<p>Two operators were instructed on how to use the interface and the meaning of 
  operationally defined categories. The intraclass coefficient (ICC) was high 
  (ICC = .88, P<0.05) across categories. This level is sufficiently high to allow 
  the remaining analyses to be carried out by one individual. </p>
<p>Results Video and Translation Ratings Participants’ ranking of quality and 
  comprehensibility of the two translation types did not vary with treatment order. 
  Furthermore, chi square analysis showed that participants significantly liked 
  the educational video (content _2=10.71, characters _2=7.12, plot _2=7.88; p<.05 
  for each category) and the quality of the ASL interpretations (_2=10.71; p<0.05). 
</p>
<p>Comprehension test The results of the comprehension test were evenly split 
  between the two treatments such that of the 8 participants who scored at least 
  4 correct out of 7 questions (57%), 4 completed the test after watching the 
  acted interpretation and 4 after watching the standard ASL interpretation. </p>
<p><i>Preferences & Features </i><br>
  While online delivery of courses is now quite common, it is not common to provide 
  concurrent ASL video translation to videos with sound as an accommodation to 
  students who are deaf. Furthermore, flexibility over the way these videos are 
  viewed (preference settings for size, position, proximity and borders enabled) 
  is an additional and innovative feature of the interface in this study. We asked 
  participants if they would be willing to pay for these features and if the features 
  were worthy of the related rise in production costs. </p>
<p>As is shown in Figure 2, 14 of the 17 participants suggested that the acted 
  video was worthy of extra production costs and that having the flexibility to 
  control how the video is viewed as less desirable than having acted video (only 
  9 of the 17 participants rated viewing preferences as more worthy or very worthy). 
  However, when asked about willingness to pay these extra costs, the affirmative 
  trend, although still there, was less distinct with a more even distribution.

<p><i>Figure 2: Worthiness of Added Production Costs. The added features are generally 
  seen as worthy of the associated rise in production cost</i>. </p>
<i>Preference Settings </i> 
<p>As might be expected, viewing preferences varied considerably from participant 
  to participant. One clearly popular setting was to have the ASL window large 
  with all but one participant stating that it was their preferred setting. Also, 
  12 of the respondents preferred to have the ASL window below the original video 
  window. Other choices such as borders and proximity showed no particular pattern 
  or preference. </p>
<i>Verbal Protocol Analysis</i> 
<p>Each of the 26 ten-minute video sessions yielded at least one coded comment 
  with the average number of comments per session being 8.4. Table 4 provides 
  a summary of the number of comments in each category. </p>

<p><i>Table 4: Count of coded comments for each category</i> </p>
<p>A moderate correlation between translation type and number of comments was 
  found [r(13) = .7] such that the acted interpretation generally garnered more 
  comments. Viewing order, however was not correlated with number of coded comments. 
  Furthermore, no association between viewing order or translation type and the 
  total number positive or negative coded comments was found thus participants 
  made positive or negative comments about the same number of times regardless 
  of the translation type or order in which the video was viewed. Table 5 summarizes 
  these findings. </p>

<p>T-tests were used to determine whether video watching order and ASL interpretation 
  type affected the quantity of positive and negative comments. There were significantly 
  more positive comments regarding technical issues during the second session 
  (t(24)=-2.3, p<.05) as well as during the acted translation (t(24)=-2.3 p<.05). 
  All but one of these comments referred to the use of costumes by the interpreter 
  actors. </p>
<p>Order was also a significant factor in three of the four comparison categories 
  with most of the comments being made during the second video session. Table

<p><i>Table 7: Mean and standard deviation for significant results in number of

<p>Most of the negative acted scores stemmed from comments about the difficulty 
  involved in watching two interpreters at the same time. When grouped by viewing 
  order, a t-test of –ve interpretation quality did approach significance (t(24)=1.9, 
  p<.07). </p>

</p>
<p><i>Discussion</i></p>
<p>Participants were not at a disadvantage for the comprehension test due to translation 
  order or video content issues. The failure rate on the comprehension test was 
  high but may relate to the task demands placed on the participants. In this 
  case, participants were conscious of reporting usability issues to the investigator 
  while at the same time working with and learning from the novel interface and 
  video. A comparison of test results to participants who are hearing and who 
  are asked to carry out the same procedures with the original video could provide 
  additional insight into the difficulties of reporting usability issues while 
  at the same time trying to learn about content. Also, since the multiple choice 
  test was presented in written English (although ASL interpretation of the questions 
  was always available) it may have been useful to include the closed caption 
  English track of the video script. In this way, participants would have opportunity 
  to see the information in the same language in which the test was presented. 
  Comprehension results would likely increase if the educational component and 
  test were part of an actual course in which the participants would have a vested 
  interest in studying and reviewing the material. The cost data shows a trend 
  towards willingness of participants to pay for either a standard or acted interpretation 
  of the video as well as for provision of viewing preferences control. This preference 
  viewing information is particularly valuable in cases where a product’s viewing 
  preferences are static. Developers of such an interface would be able to base 
  decisions on known preference data and have at least a greater chance of meeting 
  the preferences of a greater proportion of the deaf population. More research 
  on viewing preferences and their potential effect on the learning process should 
  be carried out so that accommodation standards may be determined for the courseware 
  industry. </p>
<p>The verbal protocols show that participants were able to think aloud while 
  attending to an educational video. The resulting analysis indicates that participants 
  were able to detect a variety of issues within the videos and to report these 
  issues consistently regardless of presentation order. There were no coded comments 
  regarding the ease of use of the video interface which could be considered disappointing. 
  However, this result may be accounted for in three ways. First, the video controls 
  were standard control buttons associated with a tape playing device and would 
  be very familiar to most individuals. Second, the participants were more interested 
  in the novelty of watching ASL video and were more apt to comment on related 
  video issues. Finally, the participants tended to use the controls before viewing 
  the videos, however, only protocols obtained during the video sessions are reported 
  here. </p>
<p>More negative comments about interpretation quality were made in the first 
  video session than the second video session regardless of ASL presentation. 
  Common user comments in this category related to the speed of the interpreter. 
  This issue may be mitigated by opportunity to replay the video and it is possible 
  that the repetition of the ASL in the second video session accounts for the 
  reduced number of negative comments regarding interpretation quality during 
  that session. </p>
<p>It is noteworthy that closed captioning was only requested three times. The 
  requests were made by two of the thirteen participants and each time during 
  the first video session which in both cases was a viewing of the interpreted 
  video. Since closed captions are the most common form of accommodation to video 
  material for users who are deaf, we may have expected this category to have 
  a higher count. The lower count may indicate that learners who use gestural 
  language for communication are more comfortable viewing educational material 
  in this format. It is also suggestive of the fact that generally ASL speakers 
  have lower literacy levels in a second language such as English. Certainly, 
  the result suggests that learners did not feel at a loss without video captions. 
  This finding along with findings from the survey data suggest that ASL video 
  may be a viable and possibly preferred alternative to captioned hearing videos. 
  The kind of access that learners have to the Internet has improved significantly 
  and online educational content may realistically go beyond traditional text-based 
  formats. Indeed, as this research attempts to show, alternative ways of presenting 
  educational material on the Internet are deserving of further investigation.

<p><i>Player Evaluation Evaluation Process</i> </p>
<p>Our goal was to evaluate the learnability and usability of the player tool. 
  The player tool is further described in section 2. We investigated player usability 
  as a function of ease of learning the interfaced and level of intuitiveness 
  or use for learners. Three stages of evaluation of the player were carried out: 
  heuristic evaluation, beta testing and usability testing. At each stage, the 
  course content was a segment of a physics video from the World in Motion series 
  produced by the CLT as well as content such as linked definitions, described 
  video and captions added by the research team. </p>
<p>Methods Heuristic Evaluation The formative evaluation of the player involved 
  assessment of models of the player and the player itself using heuristics developed 
  by Jakob Nielson (1994). This methodology is based on evaluation of the design 
  by expert designers using prescribed usability heuristics, with specific focus 
  on disability issues for each heuristic. These heuristics are outlined on page 
  42 of this report. </p>
<p><i>Beta Testing </i> </p>
<p>Further formative evaluation of the player involved beta-testing the player 
  by usability researchers and then by focus groups. The researchers analysed 
  the player in the role of learners. This analysis included usability heuristics, 
  user expectations, accessibility and intuitiveness. From this data, issue and 
  bug reports were created and given to the player development team. Once initial 
  issues and bugs had been reviewed and mitigated by the development team, target 
  user representatives were recruited for a more formal study. Participants worked 
  with the player individually in a standardized test format that included pre 
  and post surveys, a comprehension test and think aloud protocol. Participants 
  included individuals who are blind or have low vision, hard of hearing, learning 
  disabled, and no diagnosis. </p>
<p><i>Usability Testing</i> </p>
<p>Usability testing took the same format as the beta and focus group testing 
  but was carried out after issues raised in the earlier investigation had been 
  reported to and mitigated by the development team. User groups were as follows: 
  blind (2), low vision (2), hard of hearing (6), learning disabled (3) and no 
  diagnosis (4). In all, 17 individuals participated in the usability testing 
  phase. </p>
