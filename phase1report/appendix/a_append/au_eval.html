    <td>It surprised me that I was prompted about the type and language of a pre-made 
      caption track. Is it meant to be informative or do you really think that 
      it is appropriate to change the type at this point? Information about the 
      track is already available at the selection point so having the other window 
      pop up seems redundant and scary for Ms. Smith.</td>

      rest of them are fine) </td>

      in case (and I did do the “replace” thing although it was not obvious that 
      it did anything)</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Save presentation</td>
    <td>Where the heck does it go? OK, I found this information in the meta data 
      and have a gripe about that too. The save function should indicate where 
      the save is happening and provide opportunity to cancel the operation and 
      to change the folder location. Creation of a new folder at this point is 
      standard and should be available as well.</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
    <td>&nbsp;</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Presentation Location </td>
    <td>I used the location but added a non-existent file and a new file name 
      then hit close and then clicked save all. No error messages, no warnings 
      and the thing saved where it wanted to with the name it wanted in the first 
      place. A browse and create new folder function here would be excellent or 
      remove altogether and leave location information for the save function. 
      I guess the whole thing might be complicated by the fact it will be web-based 
      and I am treating it like it is not but even still I think following the 
      typical save set-up for a local application will make the whole thing more 
      intuitive. The most important thing, I think, is that the location information 
      be added to the save function in the form of a dialogue even if it just 
      shows the location from the meta-data without opportunity to change it there. 
      There should always be a cancel though.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Some language is techie-talk</td>
    <td>Ms. Smith would probably rather know the new style will be the same as 
      the old style except where she makes changes. Parent and inherit are not

<p>All things told, I found using the AT OK.  The dialogue boxes for meta-data seemed complicated and could have the opposite of their intended effect: users may feel overwhelmed and not enter any information rather than provide the detailed information needed to make a system like this work. I would like a less technical feeling dialogue in this area or option to have a guided walk through the meta-data inputs.  Perhaps this is where training and documentation come in as a factor.  I liked how easily I could manipulate blocks within the track and found that it was a simple task to add new tracks and tracks from the repository (this comment excludes the meta-data dialogues).</p>
