      typical save set-up for a local application will make the whole thing more

      be added to the save function in the form of a dialogue even if it just 
      shows the location from the meta-data without opportunity to change it there.

<p>All things told, I found using the AT OK.  The dialogue boxes for meta-data seemed complicated and could have the opposite of their intended effect: users may feel overwhelmed and not enter any information rather than provide the detailed information needed to make a system like this work. I would like a less technical feeling dialogue in this area or option to have a guided walk through the meta-data inputs.  Perhaps this is where training and documentation come in as a factor.  I liked how easily I could manipulate blocks within the track and found that it was a simple task to add new tracks and tracks from the repository (this comment excludes the meta-data dialogues).</p>
