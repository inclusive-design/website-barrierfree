<h4>Player Evaluation : Hard of Hearing, Caption Users</h4>

<h4>Learning</h4> <p><i>Captions and Annotations</i></p>

<p>All of the participants utilized extra features to answer the test questions. 
  Although the questions were designed to force participants to use the extra 
  features, it is significant that all of the participants regardless of their 
  comfort level with the interface did try hyperlinks in the captions to access 
  further information. Furthermore, two of the subjects examined the full text 
  captions and attempted to utilize a search function to find information within 
  the text. One subject was unsuccessful in employing her search because she had 
  her cursor in the wrong frame but definitely had a good concept of how to find 
  the information she required. All of the participants utilized the annotations, 
  however, all were told that there was information in the annotations that was 
  not available elsewhere in the captions or video. Even still, two of the participants 
  had to be directed to open annotations in order to view the additional information 
  (and find the answer to one of the questions).</p>
<p> Three of the five participants stated that it was difficult to attend to captions 
  and annotations at the same time. One participant found it impossible. While 
  participants may learn strategies for viewing captions and annotations such 
  as watching the video more than once or stepping back or forward through segments, 
  our participants seemed to prefer attempting to attend to both captions and 
  annotations. In this mode, however, 3 of the participants reported that things 
  moved too quickly. </p>
<p>Two of the participants verbalized that they liked the captions and one noted 
  that it was great to have the flexibility of positioning.</p>

</p>


<p><i>Hyperlink lists</i></p>
<p>All of the participants had to be reminded that the hyperlink list existed.  The need for reminder may have been compounded by the fact that the “show hyperlinks list” function on the general tab of the preferences dialogue was not working in the player version used for the evaluation and participants were more inclined to use this dialogue than the working settings menu.  Furthermore, only ten minutes of video were viewed by participants and while a hyperlink was displayed in the captions and annotations six times in that ten minutes, only two different links were shown.  For this reason, participants were less likely to need a listing of the hyperlinks to help their memory of the links or assist in navigating to the links. </p>

<p><i>User Errors/Bugs</i> </p>
<p>The three most common user errors were:</p>

<ol> 
<li>keying errors such as double-clicking on link lists and the TOC instead of right or ctrl clicks, </li>
<li> placing annotations and captions in the same location 
  and </li>
<li> black text on black backgrounds.</li>
</ol>

<p>The most common bug seemed to be related to the default settings whereby leaving 
  the position of captions and annotations set to default made changes to font 
  size and text type not take. Furthermore, the preview window would show the 
  incorrect text position (compared to where the text was actually showing). </p>
