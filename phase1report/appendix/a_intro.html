<h4>Introduction</h4>
<p>Advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have changed radically 
  the way individuals share, access and process information. Those with access 
  to ICT are able to share, search and store digitized information at high speeds 
  across distances that may span the globe. Large amounts of information on an 
  enormous variety of topics and from many different points of view can be easily 
  and inexpensively distributed and acquired. ICT also offers opportunities for 
  users to interact with the information and its authors in ways that can be much 
  faster and simpler than other forms of communication. </p>
<p>The capabilities of these new technologies can provide a viable alternative 
  to traditional distance education methods such as televised lectures, correspondence, 
  and electronic conferences and even to traditional school-based education. ICT 
  is poised to play a revolutionary role in how institutions, educators and learners 
  approach distance education and learning. There are also important opportunities 
  to provide distance education services to people who have excluded from these 
  traditional forms because of a lack of means to access the materials. ICT allows 
  information to be prepared and presented with alternative input and output technologies 
  to accommodate individual requirements. In addition, interaction strategies 
  can be designed to accommodate the needs of individuals rather than being prepared 
  for one delivery technique such as printed text. However, it is important that 
  access for people with disabilities be considered at the beginning of designing 
  ICT-based learning systems so that a variety of learner needs and abilities 
  can be included. </p>
<p>The Creating Barrierfree Access to Learning Environments initiative provided 
  a customizable ICT environment for on-line, video-based learning material. This 
  system allows individuals to select the method and alternative display methods. 
  For example, learners could select closed captions to be shown along with the 
  video. Users also had control over caption colour, background colour and location 
  of the captions on the display. In addition, further information that related 
  to the video-based learning material could be added such as links within closed 
  captions, and text or graphical annotations for further explanation of the existing 
  material.</p>
<p>This report provides a description of various ICT related systems and issues 
  of access on the stakeholders in education. A complete description of the Barrier-free 
  system can be found in section 2. The results of a series of evaluations related 
  to access and ICT in general, and then to the barrier-free system are presented. 
</p>
<p><i>The Classroom</i></p>
<p>The traditional classroom involves an expert teacher and a community of learners. 
  In the constructivist tradition, new knowledge is created as the teacher and 
  learners share information. Until recently, however, creating a community of 
  learners in the distance education mode was difficult and even unlikely. Instead, 
  in this mode, learning was usually a solitary process. Online education can 
  remove the barriers of separation and potential isolation amongst learners and 
  educators; it can provide opportunities for both synchronous and asynchronous 
  learning that can allow the formation of an on-line community of learners. (synchronous 
  learning takes place amongst learners at the same time (i.e. online conference) 
  and asynchronous learning occurs at different times such as with a bulletin 
  board discussion). This online community of learners is different than the community 
  of learners formed with traditional classroom environments. Olsen, Olsen &amp; 
  Meader (1995) and Hiltz et. al (1985) suggest that each technology (e.g., traditional 
  telephony, email and video conferencing) is distinctive by the nature of the 
  medium from which it is constituted. Each method of delivery has particular 
  strengths and weaknesses; some of which are due to the technologies employed. 
  The goal in using a particular technology is not to replicate identically that 
  which can be easily achieved when learners are face-to-face. Rather, it is to 
  find ways to allow participants to achieve all the interactions that are necessary 
  to complete the defined task in a productively and efficiently. It is the properties 
  of the medium that contribute to these unique experiences and influence the 
  impact of the various factors on the success of task completion and the formation 
  of the online community of learners.</p>
<p>Essentially, ICT reduces the distance in distance education but it still cannot 
  be considered identical to same place/same time teaching. Instead, one could 
  think of online learning as a classroom in which each individual is separated 
  by a rice paper wall. Communication is possible through the wall and one might 
  even be able to see the instructor or other students yet a separation exists 
  albeit a barely tangible one. </p>
<p>Learning in the rice paper classroom is comparable to the traditional classroom 
  and in some cases better than learning in the traditional classroom (Schutte, 
  J.G. 2001, Schoech, D. 2000). Schutte (2001) found that students in an online 
  statistics course taught completely over the World Wide Web, scored an average 
  of 20% higher than students learning the same subject in a traditional class 
  in mid-term and final examinations. Furthermore, the virtual class had a significantly 
  higher perceived peer contact, time spent on class work and understanding of 
  the material at semester end than the traditional class. It is important to 
  note that the online students in this study received two face-to-face sessions 
  of instructions on using the relevant technology for the course (i.e. email, 
  and Internet Relay Chat). While many Web-based courses have self-selected participants 
  who may possess the knowledge and desire to use technology necessary to participate 
  successfully in the course; provision must be made within the online course 
  for students who do not have this skill (Thomson, J.S., Stringer, S.B., 1998). 
</p>
<p><i>The Educator</i></p>
<p>Taking education online will change the role of the educator (Sweet, 2000, 
  Belanger &amp; Jordan, 2000, Baumgartner, P. &amp; Payre, S., 1998). How these 
  changes will come about and what changes we may expect are difficult to predict. 
  It is clear that virtual classrooms tend to be more learner-driven than the 
  traditional classroom (Schoech, 2000, Grubbs, L, &amp; Lockey, Mick, 2000, Wallace, 
  E. &amp; Smythe D., 1999, Dooley, K.E., Edmundson, C., Hobaugh, C., 1997). This 
  trend may be related to the flexibility of the online course as well as the 
  ease of peer contact and thoughtful discussion permitted by asynchronous communication 
  tools such as bulletin boards and email. Some suggest that traditional face-to-face 
  learning could become obsolete as computer assisted learning becomes more popular 
  and cost-effective (Schoech, 2000, Sweet, 2000, Belanger &amp; Jordan, 2000).</p>
<p>While online learning increases flexibility for the learner, the opposite seems 
  to occur for the instructor particularly if the course includes synchronous 
  chats. Most instructors report increased time demands in both the preparation 
  and mediation of their online course (Schoech, 2000,). For example, Instructors 
  may find that the amount of correspondence with students alone creates a heavy 
  workload (Schoech, 2000). Training in managing the communication technology 
  may be necessary for the online instructor.</p>
<p>Certainly, the instructor (if there is one) for an online course will need 
  to have training in courseware, relevant technology and online mediation (Wallace 
  &amp; Smythe, 1999, Thomson, Stringer &amp; Sharon, 1998). Finally, development 
  &amp; delivery of the web-based course requires collaboration between the instructor, 
  content providers, developers and technology support staff. These collaborations 
  may be a challenge to instructors who are accustomed to developing courses on 
  their own.</p>
<p><i>The Institution</i></p>
<p>The role of the institution also changes with the increase in web distance 
  learning (WDL). Indeed, the physical entity of the institution may not be necessary 
  to learners and instructors as is evidenced by the International University 
  (IU) an independent, non-profit, &laquo;virtual university&raquo; that offers 
  bachelor and master degrees in business communication only through online courses 
  (Zuniga, R.E. &amp; Pease, P., 1998). Institutions of higher education that 
  traditionally draw from local populations may see this demographic change as 
  local students become able to attend distant schools via the Internet while 
  maintaining the financial benefits of living at home with parents. At the same 
  time, some institutions will have a growing distance education population that 
  will have different needs and expectations from the local student population. 
  For example, access to resources such as journal articles and databases via 
  the Internet. </p>
<p><i>The Learner</i></p>
<p>We have already discussed that the learner typically drives learning in the 
  virtual classroom and that the learner, through online distance education, may 
  have access to learning that is equal to that of the on-campus student. Access 
  to online distance education, however, presumes that the student is able to 
  finance the technology investment required to participate successfully in the 
  program. Even with the trend towards improved technology at lower cost, this 
  investment may be unwieldy for students especially the recurring costs related 
  to having a high-speed or broadband internet service provider (ISP). </p>
<p>Students in one study of an online course reported that class discussions were 
  far richer than that in face-to-face classrooms (Schoech, 2000). Similarly, 
  all but one of the 70 respondents to a survey of IU students agreed with the 
  statement, &laquo;I would recommend that others take a course that: uses electronic 
  communication . . . &raquo; (Zuniga &amp; Pease, 1998). One explanation for 
  this difference is the flexibility of time permitted to online students particularly 
  in asynchronous discussions in which the student has time to reflect, research 
  and compose their thoughts before sharing them with the class in digitized form. 
  Other studies have shown that students in a virtual class spent significantly 
  more time on class and had a significantly higher positive affect towards the 
  course content than students of the same course in a traditional setting (Schutte, 
  2000). </p>
<p>Like educators, students must also possess the requisite technology skills 
  in order to take full advantage of an online course. In order for delivery of 
  an online course to be successful, the technical competency and support available 
  to the student must be considered (Thomson &amp; Stringer, 1998). Indeed, some 
  students may require training in order to be effective participants in web-based 
  education (Schutte, 2000, Thomson &amp; Stringer, 1998). </p>
<p>A potential benefit of distance education is the potential to make online courses 
  completely accessible to all learners provided guidelines for accessible design 
  are followed and mandated. Creating accessible online education requires a two-pronged 
  approach that considers both learners and course developers. For learners, the 
  appropriate kind of accommodation must be determined. Broadband access provides 
  opportunity to provide information in novel ways such as multiple video or caption 
  tracks. The optimal way to present educational material to learners via these 
  new methods must be investigated. For course developers, information about how 
  to provide accessible content as well as reasonable access to accessible learning 
  materials must be provided. This project addressed these two aspects of accessible 
  learning. This section of the report details the activities of the evaluation 
  component of the project. </p>
