<h2>The Tools</h2>
<p>The Authoring Tool provides educators and  content developers with a simple 
  user interface for customizing the learning content and combining learning objects 
  from the repository. Figure 2 provides a view of that interface. </p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.barrierfree.ca/examples/6.html">Figure 2: Authoring 
  Tool user interface</a></i></p>
<p>The Player provides learners with a way of customizing the educational experience 
  to meet their own individual needs and preferences. Figure 3 shows a view of 
  the Player user interface. </p>
<p><i><a href="http://www.barrierfree.ca/examples/2.html" alt="user interface">Figure 
  3. Player user interface</a></i></p>
<p>The Preferences system allows learners to define their own personal preferences 
  for the display of the content. These preferences include both the selection 
  of the content they wish to access, and how that content is presented. Figure 
  4 shows the user interface dialog used to configure the learner preferences. 
</p>

<p>The learning object repository stores the learning resources created by the 
  Authoring Tool and accessed by the Player. The Authoring Tool interfaces directly 
  with the Repository, allowing content creators to search the Repository for 
  content that matches desired criteria. Figure 5 illustrates the simple search 
  interface. </p>

<h4>E-learning Program Criteria </h4>
<p><i>Technological Innovation in Education and Training</i> </p>
<p>Prior to the Barrierfree project there were no on-line learning environments 
  with rich media that were accessible to people with disabilities. The Barrierfree 
  project models inclusion of the full range of learners. The project has developed 
  tools that allow educators to make video content both interactive and accessible. 
  It has created a repository design and data structures that allow learning content 
  to be re-purposed, and transformed according to the needs of the learner. This 
  goes well beyond other learning object repository services. The Barrierfree 
  project demonstrates innovative teaching approaches that were not possible in 
  traditional educational environments. It does not simply replicate traditional 
  educational environments. The new data structures are being incorporated into 
  international e-learning interoperability specifications. </p>
<p><i>Use of Broadband Technology</i></p>
<p>The Barrierfree project models functionality that requires broadband networks 
  and highlights the advantages of broadband. The educational content addressed 
  is video. Rather than a single stream of video the project uses multiple layers 
  of video and audio that must be closely synchronized. The server must be responsive 
  to the learner and reassemble learning objects on the fly according to the needs 
  of the learner. All of these functions require broadband. Because not all participants 
  in the Barrierfree project had access to broadband during the project, local 
  servers were set up with captive networks which simulated broadband. </p>
<p><i>Addressing Structural Barriers</i> </p>
<p>The primary structural barrier addressed by the Barrierfree project was the 
  digital divide created by the lack of accessibility of our educational systems 
  for people with disabilities. The social and economic impact of this barrier 
  is significant. At least 15% of learners in Canada have a disability. Exclusion 
  of this group of Canadians from educational opportunities puts untenable strains 
  on our social safety net and deprives us of the valuable contributions these 
  learners can make to our economic and social well being. Many of Canada’s trading 
  partners have recognized the need for inclusive technologies and will not purchase 
  our exports unless they are accessible. The Barrierfree project models products 
  that meet accessibility requirements and are used as models of best practice 
  by international trading partners. </p>
