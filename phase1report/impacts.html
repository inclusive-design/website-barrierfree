<h2>Socio-economic Impacts </h2>
<p><i>Beneficiaries</i><br />
  The primary beneficiaries of the projects are learners with disabilities and 
  other learners who have been marginalized by traditional education environments 
  because they have learning needs that differ from the norm. The modifications 
  and learner scaffolds developed however, benefit all learners. An associated 
  group of beneficiaries are educators of students with special needs. The project 
  results allow educators to customize learning material to meet the individual 
  learning needs of their students. </p>
<p>The project results can be used in any educational sector including: preschool 
  to high school, college and university, vocational training and upgrading, professional 
  development and life long learning. The application of the project results would 
  help these sectors to meet their human rights commitments and legislative obligations. 
  Application of the project results would assist private enterprise developing 
  and marketing e-learning products to meet procurement requirements regarding 
  accessibility. </p>
<p class="right"><a href="#top"><img src="img/top.gif" width="14" height="13" alt="top"></a></p>
<p><i>Intended Impacts</i><br />
  The project is intended to give learners with disabilities access to learning 
  opportunities they have not had access to. Examples include: </p>
<ul>
  <li>access to information communicated through audio by people who are deaf 
    or hard of hearing </li>
  <li>access to information communicated through graphics and video by people 
    who are blind or have low vision </li>
  <li>access to information communicated through print or symbols for people who 
    are print impaired, and </li>
  <li>the ability to interact with learning material for people who have physical 
    disabilities. </li>
</ul>
<p> It is also intended to support learners who require additional support to 
  integrate new concepts. These improved and increased learning opportunities 
  have to potential to improve vocational opportunities, health and quality of 
  life for the learners. If these learners can meet their educational potential 
  they will not be dependent on social support systems but contribute to Canadian 
  social and economic systems. </p>
<p>Canadian e-learning developers who create inclusive products will improve the 
  marketability of their products to markets in Europe, Australia, New Zealand 
  and the US, who each have procurement guidelines that dictate inclusive educational 
  tools and content. </p>
<p class="right"><a href="#top"><img src="img/top.gif" width="14" height="13" alt="top"></a></p>
<p><i>Actual Impacts</i><br />
  &nbsp;For beneficiaries who did not participate in the project, the intended 
  benefits are beginning to appear. The models, data structures and functionality 
  modeled in the Barrierfree project are now in draft international specifications 
  and accessibility guidelines. A number of developers have begun to integrate 
  similar functionality into their tools and content offerings. The Barrierfree 
  models have made their way into policy documents such as the National Centre 
  for Accessible Media policies, and the Learning Federation accessibility policies. 
  Educational institutions, which have not known how to meet their accessibility 
  obligations when using rich media, are using the Barrierfree results as exemplars. 
  These include Canadian institutions as well as education systems such as the 
  Texas Education Agency, the Chancellors Office of California Colleges and the 
  State of Florida. </p>
<p><i>Contribution to Technical Research, Organizational and Pedagogical Innovation</i><br />
  The Barrierfree project has raised the bar for inclusive learning. It has demonstrated 
  that even a media, such as video, that is least amenable to personalized transformation 
  can be enriched in such a way that the learning experience is engaging, supportive 
  and accessible to all learners. The project has not simply implemented existing 
  technologies in a new way in an e-learning domain, it has developed new and 
  innovative technologies. It has modeled data structures to enable the transformation 
  of linear video into non-linear, interactive learning objects. By doing so it 
  has set new standards for learner-centric education. </p>

<h4>Role of CANARIE </h4>
<p>The forums created by CANARIE which brought the various projects funded within 
  e-learning and others interested in e-learning together were invaluable. These 
  meetings created a community of interest on the topic of broadband on-line learning 
  in Canada. They provided an opportunity for the Barrierfree project to advocate 
  for accessible design practices in other projects. The forums also encouraged 
  collaboration and the adoption of standard practices. Partly because of this 
  strong community of interest encouraged by CANARIE, other initiatives have developed 
  including the Industry Canada Eduspecs office, collaboration with like communities 
  worldwide, and strong Canadian involvement with the IMS Global Learning Consortium. 
  The efforts of CANARIE represent one of the few initiatives concerned with education 
  that span all provinces and territories and therefore provide a rare opportunity 
  for pan-Canadian discourse on the future of education in Canada.</p>
<p>To further support collaboration between projects CANARIE could establish a 
  mechanism for conducting and billing for collaborative work. The Barrierfree 
  deliverables will be further developed and implemented in the ABEL project also 
  funded by CANARIE. An efficient mechanism whereby ABEL can incorporate billings 
  for this work would assist in this collaboration. </p>
<p>Streamlining of the reporting mechanisms would assist the CANARIE projects. 
  The rigorous project management practices encouraged by CANARIE should be maintained 
  but there is redundant or unused information that is required that could be 
  eliminated or replaced with more useful information. </p>
