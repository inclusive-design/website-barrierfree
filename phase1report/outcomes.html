<h2 align="left">Direct Outcomes </h2>
<p><i>The Barrierfree Learning Object Structure</i></p>
<p>Educational videos or films have been a powerful mechanism for teaching a large 
  range of topics for a number of decades. They have been successful in engaging 
  learners when other teaching tools do not. Video is the type of rich media broadband 
  networks are intended for. One disadvantage of video is that it is inaccessible 
  to learners with sensory disabilities and it forces the learner to progress 
  through the content in a prescribed sequence and at a prescribed pace. Of the 
  media types available for on-line learning, video is also the least amenable 
  to transformation and customization. The Barrierfree project chose this most 
  challenging media type to demonstrate the techniques and learning advantages 
  of creating inclusive on-line learning environments. </p>
<p>Due to legislation in a number of countries, many videos or films intended 
  for broadcast are accompanied by verbatim closed captions. Captions are a text 
  transcript of what is spoken or heard in a video or film. These captions are 
  precisely synchronized to the video. A number of films or videos also have accompanying 
  video descriptions. These are verbal descriptions of what is seen in the video. 
  These descriptions form a synchronized audio track that intersperses the descriptions 
  in the quiet sections of the video’s original audio track. The Barrierfree project 
  uses both the verbatim caption and the transcript of the video description to 
  create a framework for the video content. This text track framework is used 
  to enrich the film and make it interactive by acting as a backbone that indexes 
  the video and links enriching content to the video. Supporting content, interactive 
  exercises, definitions of terms, self evaluations, background material and learner 
  scaffolds are linked to the captions and video descriptions. Thus if a learner 
  viewing a physics video encounters a term they do not understand, they can click 
  on the term in the caption, view a definition of the term, experience an interactive 
  exercise of the concept, navigate back to the point in the video when the term 
  was introduced, or reinforce their understanding of the concept in a number 
  of other ways. </p>
<p class="right"><a href="#top"><img src="img/top.gif" width="14" height="13" alt="top"></a></p>
<p>The text-track framework is also the basis for re-purposing a lesson. An educator 
  who wishes to adapt an existing enriched video for the learning needs and curriculum 
  requirements of their class can do so by swapping or adding the auxiliary content. 
  Caption tracks at reduced reading levels or in alternative languages can be 
  added. Linked exercises or supporting material can be replaced with local examples 
  or examples more relevant to the students. Links to self evaluations appropriate 
  to the curriculum requirements can be added. Teacher annotations in audio, text 
  or graphic form can be added. </p>


<p>The learning object repository developed in the Barrierfree project supports 
  this repurposing and customized viewing of the enriched video content by maintaining 
  information about the learning content in two forms: the assembly object and 
  the content object. The assembly object records how the original video and the 
  enriched content are assembled. The content objects are the reusable components 
  that can be used in assembling the lesson. A number of derivative assembly objects 
  can be stored in the repository, so that when an educator customizes the original 
  enriched video their version of the assembly object is stored as well as the 
  original. </p>
<p class="right"><a href="#top"><img src="img/top.gif" width="14" height="13" alt="top"></a></p>
<p>All the Barrierfree tools also support the personalization of the learning 
  content. The learner can specify how they wish the content to be displayed, 
  which content components they wish displayed and how they wish to control the 
  content. </p>
<p>As well as accessibility, the Barrierfree project is committed to interoperability. 
  The technologies were developed using Java, and data was encoded using XML. 
  Figure 1 provides an overview of the components that were developed, and their 
  interactions. The underlying system consists of a core set of Java classes for 
  representing learning objects and their metadata, a set of Java classes for 
  representing the captions (which act as the backbone for the presentation) and 
  other time-based information such as the video descriptions, and graphical overlays, 
  and a set of Java classes for maintaining the learner preferences. </p>
