          Meeting the Needs of Diverse Learners</em></font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Third 
          TILE community potluck event was held 14 November in Fredericton, New 
          Brunswick, hosted by the National adult Literacy Database (NALD). The 
          event was held at the Wu Conference Centre at the University of New 
          Brunswick, and was the third of four planned TILE Community Potlucks 
          coordinated by the Adaptive Technology Resource Centre (ATRC). These 
          community potlucks occur every quarter, and are designed to give partners 
          updates as to the TILE project progress, as well as to get insight and 
          input as to the TILE development process.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The TILE 
          potluck event in Fredericton had in attendance people from NALD, Frontier 
          College, the University of Toronto&#8217;s Transitional year Program, 
          the National Research Council, various provincial literacy and educational 
          organizations, the ATRC, and others. The theme of the event was &#8220;Meeting 
          the Needs of Diverse Learners.&#8221; Participants were asked to respond 
          to an initial overview by Jutta Treviranus, director of the ATRC. Jutta 
          provided participants with an overview of the goals of the TILE project, 
          as well as the outline for the day&#8217;s activities. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Participants 
          were asked to consider what &#8220;Meeting the Needs of Diverse Learners&#8221; 
          could or would entail with respect to the provision of e-learning content. 
          The idea was to get feedback into the kinds of content transformations 
          would best help meet the needs of diverse learners accessing e-learning 
          content. Within this conceptual framework, participants were asked to 
          consider the following questions: What types of learning breakdown can 
          be addressed with individualized instruction? What parameters do we 
          customize to the individual to promote learning? What parameters can 
          be individualized in an online environment? What supports do educators 
          need to deliver individualized or learner-centric instruction? These 
          questions were intended to stimulate discussion on leaner and educator 
          supports that could be built, as well as to what content transformations 
          would be most useful &#8211; and usable &#8211; for learners with &#8220;learning 
          challenges.&#8221;</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Breakout 
          groups were then formed to get four different perspectives on the issues 
          being discussed. Each group was asked to list learning barriers and 
          the strategies for overcoming the barriers. They then created one or 
          two examples of learners and their preferences, and detailed ways in 
          which these preferences and barriers could work within a particular 
          learning objective. This learning objective was designed to get people 
          thinking about content transformations and multimedia, learning styles, 
          as well as to provide examples of how TILE content to date can be cross-purposed 
          and reused to provide the kinds of learner supports that would be helpful 
          to those who may face a particular obstacle in learning, and what providing 
          these may mean to the educator.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Each group 
          was then asked to present their overviews to the rest of the participants. 
          These led to fruitful discussions on the nature of transformations and 
          the potential these may have for learners.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Various 
          themes emerged from the various breakout groups and their discussions 
          of learning challenges, strategies, and educator needs. There was general 
          agreement that various learning styles and abilities can be met with 
          assistive technologies (screen readers, text-to-speech, etc.) that would 
          benefit learners with low literacy levels. Educators would find useful 
          resources that would enable them to provide &#8220;remedial detours&#8221; 
          for their students should these be needed. These kinds of scaffolding 
          supports could be available based on need and learning context. Supports 
          for peer interaction would be beneficial, as would alternative ways 
          for students to participate in aspects of learning activities (online 
          presentations and video, versus in person presentations, for example). 
          The idea of peer interaction and mentoring was raised as a good way 
          to encourage critical reflection and reflective learning among learners 
          who may not have good learning skills to begin with, or are shy or face 
          some other obstacle to full and meaningful participation in learning 
          activities. Ways of enabling anonymous feedback were also seen as having 
          potential for shy students.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Participants 
          identified various resources that educators could utilize, acknowledging 
          that when we are dealing with learner content transformations and scaffolds, 
          this puts addition demand on educators and instructors. Technical support 
          and assistance with aspects of online instruction, adaptive technology, 
          and familiarity with learning styles and theory were identified as being 
          potentially helpful. Educators will need to know how to meet various 
          learning styles and challenges, why this is important, and what it means 
          to their instruction. The idea of fostering communities of educators 
          fits well with the TILE mandate of encouraging a shared repository of 
          resources that can be easily reused by many educators. Communities of 
          educators would also help in the provision of assistance for technical 
          and learning matters, as collective knowledge generation about meeting 
          the needs of diverse learners would help the community as a whole learn 
          how best to use transformable content and various scaffolds to the best 
          educational advantage. </font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Anastasia 
          Cheetham, TILE Software Designer at the ATRC, then presented to the 
          entire group some of the transformations currently possible in the TILE 
          Repository Service Web Interface (RSWI). Participants were shown how 
          the TILE preferences system works to enable learners to easily customize 
          their learning interface. Robert Luke, ATRC researcher, ended the day 
          with a brief review of the social context of flexible e-learning and 
          asked participants to consider issues of interaction and evaluation 
          with respect to providing multiple learning paths for learners.</font></p>
        <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The TILE 
          community potluck in Fredericton was successful in generating very good 
          discussion about the implications of customizing content presentation. 
          The ATRC team received good feedback on the state of the TILE work to 
          date, as well as key input as to future directions the service could 
          take. The event raised several key questions about content scaffolds, 
          software supports, and future hardware and software needs that would 
          be ideal in any future e-learning environment. </font></p>
