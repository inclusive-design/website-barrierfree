      <h1 align="left">Accessible and Customizable Educational Videos</h1>
        
      <p> Project lead partners, <a href="http://www.clt.ca/">Canadian Learning 
        Television</a>, are the producers of an excellent physics educational 
        video series, which was used by the project as the base material for illustrating 
        the benefits of providing a flexible, customizable and accessible educational 
        experience for learners. Entitled "Physics- A World in Motion", the 48 
        part series is intended to provide high school students with instruction 
        in the fundamentals of physics. Episode one of the series, entitled "Energy 
        Transformations" has been enhanced with the features available through 
        the newly designed Barrier - Free Authoring Tool and Player to illustrate 
        the benefits of approaching educational videos in this innovative fashion 
        to take advantage of the benefits of broadband to combat learning barriers. 
      <h2>Core Content- Why Physics?</h2>
      <p> Difficulties for students with disabilities in accessing science related 
        learning materials are numerous. Students who are blind cannot see graphs 
        or illustrations. Imagine listening to a science video in which the on-screen 
        teacher refers to an on-screen equation, but never actually reads out 
        all of the elements of the equation in sequence. Following along with 
        the steps involved in solving such a problem would be close to impossible. 
        Students who are deaf, as the result of English literacy issues also have 
        difficulty with science because of the complex language used in scientific 
        theories. The complex language and mathematical elements of science can 
        also pose a problem for students with learning disabilities. Video content 
        often moves too quickly for a learner with a learning disability, and 
        this difficulty is only compounded when the topic is science, which requires 
        the ongoing application of complex language, logic and math skills. 
      <p> The Barrier - Free Player and Authoring Tool allow teachers/authors 
        to enhance educational online videos through the addition of: 
      <ul>
        <li> Caption Tracks 
        <li> Audio Descriptions 
        <li> Insertion of Hyperlinks 
        <li> Annotations 
        <li> Non-linear navigational structure 
      </ul>
      <p> <a href="index.html">Screen shots of the Barrier - Free Player and Authoring 
        Tool are available. </a> 
      <h2>Caption Tracks:</h2>
      <p> Video content that is played on the player utilizes the video's caption 
        track as a built-in source of text that can accompany any viewing of a 
        video. For students who are deaf, having the captions available to view 
        is of obvious benefit, but the captions are also beneficial to other students 
        as well. 
      <p> Students with learning disabilities can read along through the caption 
        track while viewing the video, then pause the video to re-read any sections 
        that may have been confusing. As the style of the caption track can be 
        set by the student, font size, spacing between words, caption box location 
        and colours for text and background can all be set according to the learners 
        preferences. 
      <p> Teachers can also set preferences for sections of captions they wish 
        to control the presentation of, but in general there is flexibility imparted 
        to the user to arrange the content in a manner which suits their specific 
        learning goals and tastes. Even the presence of the caption track itself 
        is an option. Should the learner benefit more from simply viewing the 
        video, captions can be turned off entirely and not presented. 
      <p> Finally, students and teachers have the option of choosing between more 
        than one caption track. By using the authoring tool, teachers can author 
        their own caption text to accompany an educational video. Should the teacher 
        have students in the class who require a literacy reduced version of the 
        content in a video, the teacher can author that text using the Barrier 
        - Free Authoring Tool. Students would then select the appropriate track 
        and follow along with it instead of the original caption track for the 
        video. For our demonstration, we have included both a verbatim caption 
        track from the episode "Energy Transformations", as well as a French language 
        version of the captions that students can select between. 
      <h2>Audio Descriptions</h2>
      <p> Audio descriptions are fitted into the spaces of the standard audio 
        track and act to describe what's happening on-screen for people who are 
        blind. Due to the space limitations imposed by this delivery model, people 
        who are blind are often given insufficient information about onscreen 
        events to be able to follow the content of the video fully. 
      <p> The Barrier - Free Player has overcome this difficulty by pausing the 
        video automatically whenever an audio description that is longer than 
        the space allotted it occurs. Audio descriptions of this video were developed 
        by project partner the <a href="http://www.cnib.ca/">Canadian National 
        Institute for the Blind (CNIB)</a>. In doing so, the CNIB has broken ground 
        in developing a new model for provision of audio descriptions to users 
        who are blind. 
      <h2>Insertion of Hyperlinks:</h2>
      <p> Using the caption track, it is possible for teachers to customize any 
        educational video to their own instructional needs by inserting hyperlinks 
        directly into the video. As a student is viewing the video and its accompanying 
        caption track, hyperlinked captions appear. Students, upon encountering 
        such a hyperlink can pause the video, activate the hyperlink and proceed 
        to any web based content their teacher had identified as being relevant 
        to the material being covered. Teachers can include links to educational 
        materials they have developed themselves, or to resources that already 
        exist on the World Wide Web. 
      <p> This feature allows the ultimate flexibility in applying video based 
        educational content to a specific learning environment as through the 
        hyperlinks selected, teachers can define exactly what they want their 
        students to focus on, and even provide students with localized resources 
        that are directly relevant to their experience. 
      <p> For example, a teacher Toronto using the "Energy Transformations" episode 
        to teach students about kinetic energy could build into the video a hyperlink 
        from the term "examples of kinetic energy" that connects students to <a href="http://www.canadas-wonderland.com/">Canada 
        Wonderland's</a> web site. From there students could be asked to work 
        on the problem of determining the kinetic energy produced on a roller 
        coaster most, because of the park's proximity to Toronto, would have actually 
        ridden on. A teacher in Edmonton may use hyperlinks to construct the same 
        kind of real-life kinetic energy problem, but would direct her hyperlink 
        instead to the web site for <a href="http://www.westedmall.com/entertainment/galaxyland.shtml">West 
        Edmonton Mall's Galaxyland</a> theme park. 
      <p> Of course, localizing the information in a video is only one possible 
        way of using a hyperlink feature. Teachers may also choose to link to 
        educational supports, class web pages, definitions for words or bulletin 
        boards too. 
      <p> In order to ensure the accessibility of the hyperlinks to all learners, 
        students can set a user preference in the player that allows them to hear 
        an audio tone played whenever a hyperlink is available in the captions, 
        and then are able to use a key-board shortcut to activate the link. Students 
        can also display, should they so choose, all of the links in a video in 
        a separate "Link Box" and navigate materials from there. 
      <p> Links in the sample video developed by the Barrier- Free project team 
        connect to supplementary materials intended to clarify physics concepts, 
        as well as links to resources relevant to physics available on the World 
        Wide Web. Links to examples of these materials are available below: 
      <ul>
        <li><a href="material/air_puck.html">How the Air Puck Works </a> 
        <li><a href="material/metric_prefixes.html">A Further Explanation of Metric 
          Prefixes </a> 
        <li><a href="material/reducing_gymnast_friction.html">Reducing Friction 
          </a>

        <li><a href="material/dropofdoom/drop-of-doom.html">Interactive Simulation 
          of The Drop of Doom </a> 
      </ul>
      <h2>Annotations:</h2>
      <p> Annotation are another key feature available in both the Player and 
        Authoring tool enabling customized video materials to meet diverse learning 
        needs. Annotations are short notes that teachers and students can add 
        into the video content. Annotations can serve many purposes including 
        drawing a student's attention to specific parts of the video, providing 
        additional relevant information , or even allowing the student to highlight 
        a section he or she finds particularly helpful. 
      <h2>Non-linear Navigational Structure:</h2>
      <p> The Barrier- Free Player and Authoring Tool provide the ability to break 
        an educational video up into smaller chunks and allow navigation through 
        the video in a non-linear fashion. For the first time, teachers can direct 
        students to view smaller sections of a video without having to fast forward 
        through an actual videotape. Non-linear navigation of the video allows 
        teachers the flexibility of choosing which parts of the video they would 
        like their students to watch and in what order. It also allows students 
        the ability to jump back and forth between sections of the video that 
        they feel they need repeated viewings of in order to understand. The non-linear 
        structure of the video then becomes something more akin to a text book, 
        that students can flip through at will, but unlike a textbook the video 
        content and it's navigational structure are fully accessible to learners 
        with special needs.
