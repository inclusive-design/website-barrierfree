  <li>Keyboard navigation into the Flash plug-in (tabbing) only works with Internet 
    Explorer, version 5 and higher.</li>
  <li>The number of TAB presses to enter the plug-in differs according to the 
    browser setup.</li>
  <li>The instructions button is not read properly when focus is first switched

    All the other buttons work properly.</li>
  <li>Pressing ENTER multiple times in quick succession may cause the sounds to 
    be played strangely.</li>
